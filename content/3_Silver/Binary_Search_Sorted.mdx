import { Problem } from '../models';

export const problems = {
	bubble: [
		new Problem(

			'https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-bubble-sort/problem',

};

Suppose that we want to find an element in a sorted array of size $N$ in $O(\log N)$ time. We can do this with [**binary search**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm); each iteration of the binary search cuts the search space in half, so the algorithm tests $O(\log N)$ values. This is efficient and much better than testing every element in an array.

## Coordinate Compression

A related topic is **coordinate compression**, which takes some points and reassigns them to remove wasted space.

> Farmer John has just arranged his $N$ haybales $(1\le N \le 100,000)$ at various points along the one-dimensional road running across his farm. To make sure they are spaced out appropriately, please help him answer $Q$ queries ($1 \le Q \le 100,000$), each asking for the number of haybales within a specific interval along the road.

However, each of the points are in the range $0 \ldots 1,000,000,000$, meaning you can't store locations of haybales in, for instance, a boolean array.

<Spoiler title="Solution">

Let's place all of the locations of the haybales into a list and sort it.

(fix part below so transform to range $1\ldots N$)

<IncompleteSection />

<!-- Now, we can map distinct points to smaller integers without gaps. For example, if the haybales existed at positions $[1, 4, 5, 9]$ and queries were $(1, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$, we can place the integers together and map them from $[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9] \rightarrow [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$. This effectively transforms the haybale positions into $[1, 3, 4, 6]$ and the queries into $1, 2$ and $3, 5$.

By compressing queries and haybale positions, we've transformed the range of points to $0 \ldots N + 2Q$, allowing us to store prefix sums to effectively query for the number of haybales in a range.
