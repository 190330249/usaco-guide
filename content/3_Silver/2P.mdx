### Solution - Books

We want to find the longest continuous segment of books that can be read within $t$ minutes. 

To accomplish this, we can define $\texttt{left}$ and $\texttt{right}$ as the start and end of the segment respectively.

For every $\texttt{left}$ index, we need to increase our $\texttt{right}$ pointer until the total time for that segment exceeds $t$.

We will keep track of the total time with $\texttt{cur}$.

Once $\texttt{cur}$ exceeds $t$, we remove the current $\texttt{right}$-indexed book and decrement $\texttt{right}$ by 1.

We will keep track of the max segment size with $\texttt{ans}$, and take the maximum between $\texttt{ans}$ and $\texttt{right} - \texttt{left}$.

We can then remove the $\texttt{left}$-indexed book from $\texttt{cur} and increment $\texttt{left}$ by 1.
