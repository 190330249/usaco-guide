## Functional Graphs

We'll consider graphs like the one presented in this problem:

<Problems problems={problems.sample} />

< br/>

In a **functional graph**, each node has exactly one out-edge. 
This is also commonly referred to as a **successor graph**.

### Implementation

The following sample code counts the number of cycles in such a graph. The "stack" contains nodes that can reach the current node. If the current node points to a node `v` on the stack (`on_stack[v]` is true), then we know that a cycle has been created. However, if the current node points to a node `v` that has been previously visited but is not on the stack, then we know that the current chain of nodes points into a cycle that has already been considered.

```cpp
//UNTESTED

//Each node points to next_node[node]

bool visited[MAXN], on_stack[MAXN];
int number_of_cycles = 0, next_node[MAXN];
void dfs(int n)
{
	visited[n] = on_stack[n] = true;
	int u = next_node[n];
	if(on_stack[u])
		number_of_cycles++;
	else if(!visited[u])
		dfs(u);
	on_stack[n] = false;
}
int main()
{
	//read input, etc
	for(int i = 1;i <= N;i++)
		if(!visited[i])
			dfs(i);
}
```

</CPPSection>

## Floyd's Algorithm

**Floyd's Algorithm**, also commonly referred to as the **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**, is capable of detecting cycles in a functional graph in $O(N)$ time and $O(1)$ memory (not counting the graph itself)

</Resources>

### Implementation

```cpp
//UNTESTED
pair<int, int> detect_cycle(int *next, int start_node) //return pair(length of cycle, distance from start node to in cycle)
{
	int t=start_node, h=start_node; //tortoise and hare
	do
	{
		t=next[t], h=next[h];
	} while(t != h)

	int dist=0;
	t = start_node;
	while(t != h)
		++dist, t=next[t], h=next[h];
	
	int len=1;
	h = next[t];
	while(h != t)
		++len, h=next[h];
	return make_pair(len, dist);
}
```
