It's easy to solve the above problem in $O(N^2)$ time. We'll solve it in $O(N)$.


## Introduction

In a **functional graph**, each node has exactly one out-edge. This is also commonly referred to as a **successor graph**. 

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="16.3 Successor Graphs" starred>diagrams</Resource>
</Resources>

You can think of every connected component of a functional graph as a rooted tree plus an additional edge going out of the root.

## Floyd's Algorithm

**Floyd's Algorithm**, also commonly referred to as the **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**, is capable of detecting cycles in a functional graph in $O(N)$ time and $O(1)$ memory (not counting the graph itself).

<!-- ## Count Cycles

The following sample code counts the number of cycles in such a graph. The "stack" contains nodes that can reach the current node. If the current node points to a node `v` on the stack (`on_stack[v]` is true), then we know that a cycle has been created. However, if the current node points to a node `v` that has been previously visited but is not on the stack, then we know that the current chain of nodes points into a cycle that has already been considered.
