<br />

When we binary search on an answer, we start with a search space of size $N$ which we know the answer lies in. Then each iteration of the binary search cuts the search space in half, so the algorithm tests $O(\log N)$ values. This is efficient and much better than testing each possible value in the search space.

Let's say we have a function `check(x)` that returns `true` if the answer of $x$ is possible, and `false` otherwise. Usually, in such problems, we want to find the maximum or minimum value of $x$ such that `check(x)` is true. Similarly to how binary search on an array only works on a sorted array, binary search on the answer only works if the answer function is [monotonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function), meaning that it is always non-decreasing or always non-increasing. 

In particular, if we want to find the maximum `x` such that `check(x)` is true, then we can binary search if `check(x)` satisfies both of the following conditions:

 - If `check(x)` is `true`, then `check(y)` is true for all $y \leq x$.
 - If `check(x)` is `false`, then `check(y)` is false for all $y \geq x$.

For example, the last point at which the condition below is satisfied is 5.

```
check(1) = true
check(2) = true
check(3) = true
check(4) = true
check(5) = true
check(6) = false
check(7) = false
check(8) = false
```

If instead we're looking for the minimum `x` that satisfies some condition, then we can binary search if `check(x)` satisfies both of the following conditions:

 - If `check(x)` is true, then `check(y)` is true for all $y \geq x$.
 - If `check(x)` is false, then `check(y)` is false for all $y \leq x$.

The binary search function for this is very similar. We will need to do the same thing, but when the condition is satisfied, we will cut the right part, and when it's not, the left part will be cut. 

Below, we present several algorithms for binary search, which search for the maximum `x` such that `check(x)` is true. 

```cpp
int l = range_start, r = range_end, res = -1;
while(l <= r) {
    int mid = (l + r) / 2; // find the middle of the current range
    if (check(mid) == true) { 
        // if mid works, then all numbers smaller than mid also work
        // so we only care about the part after mid
        res = mid; // update the answer
        l = mid + 1; // cut the part before mid
        // notice that we already handled mid itself so we cut it as well
    } else {
        // if mid does not work, greater values would not work too
        // so we don't care about them
        r = mid - 1; // cut mid and after
    }
}
// now res is the answer
// if res is still -1 that means no value in the range satisfies the condition
```

Here is a second implementation from Benq:

```cpp
int fstTrue(function<bool(int)> f, int lo, int hi) {
  hi ++; assert(lo <= hi); // assuming f is increasing
  while (lo < hi) { // find first index such that f is true 
    int mid = (lo+hi)/2; // returns hi+1 if no index exists
    f(mid) ? hi = mid : lo = mid+1; 
  } 
  return lo;
}

int main() {
  cout << fstTrue([](int x) { return 1; },2,10)) << "\n"; // 2
  cout << fstTrue([](int x) { return x >= 5; },2,10)) << "\n"; // 5
  cout << fstTrue([](int x) { return x >= 20; },2,10)) << "\n"; // 11
}
```

(todo: remove one of these)

There is also another approach to binary searching based on interval jumping. Essentially, we start from the beginning of the array, make jumps, and reduce the jump length as we get closer to the target element.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
long long search(){
    long long pos = 0; long long max = 2E9;
    for(long long a = max; a >= 1; a /= 2){
        while(check(pos+a)) pos += a;
    }
    return pos;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
static long search(){
    long pos = 0; long max = (long)2E9;
    for(long a = max; a >= 1; a /= 2){
        while(check(pos+a)) pos += a;
    }
    return pos;
}
```

## Example: Maximum Median

<problems-list problems={metadata.problems.ex} />

**Statement:** Given an array $\texttt{arr}$ of $n$ integers, where $n$ is odd, we can perform the following operation on it $k$ times: take any element of the array and increase it by $1$. We want to make the median of the array as large as possible after $k$ operations.

**Constraints:** $1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \leq k \leq 10^9$ and $n$ is odd.

**Solution:** We first sort the array in ascending order. Then, we binary search for the maximum possible median. We know that the number of operations required to raise the median to $x$ increases monotonically as $x$ increases, so we can use binary search. For a given median value $x$, the number of operations required to raise the median to $x$ is

$$
\sum_{i=(n+1)/2}^{n} \max(0, x - \texttt{arr}[i]).
$$

If this value is less than or equal to $k$, then $x$ can be the median, so our check function returns `true`. Otherwise, $x$ cannot be the median, so our check function returns `false`.

The solution codes use the jump implementation of binary search.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
int n;
long long k;
vector<long long> v;

// checks whether the number of given operations is sufficient
// to raise the median of the array to x
bool check(long long x){
    long long operationsNeeded = 0;
    for(int i = (n-1)/2; i < n; i++){
        operationsNeeded += max(0, x-v[i]);
    }
    if(operationsNeeded <= k) return true; 
    else return false; 
}

// binary searches for the correct answer
long long search(){
    long long pos = 0; long long max = 2E9;
    for(long long a = max; a >= 1; a /= 2){
        while(check(pos+a)) pos += a;
    }
    return pos;
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> k;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        int t;
        cin >> t;
        v.push_back(t);
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());

    cout << search() << '\n';
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
static int n;
static long k;
static long[] arr;
public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    n = r.nextInt(); k = r.nextLong();
    arr = new long[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        arr[i] = r.nextLong();
    }
    Arrays.sort(arr);

    pw.println(search());
    pw.close();
}

// binary searches for the correct answer
static long search(){
    long pos = 0; long max = (long)2E9;
    for(long a = max; a >= 1; a /= 2){
        while(check(pos+a)) pos += a;
    }
    return pos;
}

// checks whether the number of given operations is sufficient
// to raise the median of the array to x
static boolean check(long x){
    long operationsNeeded = 0;
    for(int i = (n-1)/2; i < n; i++){
        operationsNeeded += Math.max(0, x-arr[i]);
    }
    if(operationsNeeded <= k){ return true; }
    else{ return false; }
}
```
