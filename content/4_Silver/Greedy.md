**Greedy** algorithms select the optimal choice at each step instead of looking at the solution space as a whole. This reduces the problem to a smaller problem at each step.

<!-- END DESCRIPTION -->

Greedy does not refer to a single algorithm, but rather a way of thinking that is applied to problems. There's no one way to do greedy algorithms. Hence, we use a selection of well-known examples to help you understand the greedy paradigm.

Usually, when using a greedy algorithm, there is a heuristic or value function that determines which choice is considered most optimal.
