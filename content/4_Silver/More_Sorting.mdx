## Sorting Algorithms

(why are these important?)

There are many sorting algorithms, here are some sources to learn about the popular ones:

### Tutorial

<problems-list problems={metadata.problems.bubble} />

  - [HackerEarth Quicksort](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/quick-sort/tutorial/)
    - expected $O(N\log N)$
  - [HackerEarth Mergesort](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort/tutorial/)
    - $O(N\log N)$

## Binary Search

[Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) can be used on monotonic (\*what's that?) functions for a logarithmic runtime.

\*monotonic means *nondecreasing* or *nonincreasing*

Here is a very basic form of binary search:

> Find an element in a sorted array of size $N$ in $O(\log N)$ time.

Other variations are similar, such as the following:

> Given $K$, find the largest element less than $K$ in a sorted array.

## Coordinate Compression

Another useful application of sorting is **coordinate compression**, which takes some points and reassigns them to remove wasted space. 

<problems-list problems={metadata.problems.count} />

> Farmer John has just arranged his $N$ haybales $(1\le N \le 100,000)$ at various points along the one-dimensional road running across his farm. To make sure they are spaced out appropriately, please help him answer $Q$ queries ($1 \le Q \le 100,000$), each asking for the number of haybales within a specific interval along the road.

However, each of the points are in the range $0 \ldots 1,000,000,000$, meaning you can't store locations of haybales in, for instance, a boolean array. 

### Solution

Let's place all of the locations of the haybales into a list and sort it.

(fix part below so transform to range $1\ldots N$)

Now, we can map distinct points to smaller integers without gaps. For example, if the haybales existed at positions $[1, 4, 5, 9]$ and queries were $(1, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$, we can place the integers together and map them from $[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9] \rightarrow [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$. This effectively transforms the haybale positions into $[1, 3, 4, 6]$ and the queries into $1, 2$ and $3, 5$.

By compressing queries and haybale positions, we've transformed the range of points to $0 \ldots N + 2Q$, allowing us to store prefix sums to effectively query for the number of haybales in a range.
