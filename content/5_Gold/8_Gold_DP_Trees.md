## Tutorial

  * [DP on Trees (Codeforces)](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/20935)
  * ??

## Problems

  * [Subtree](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_v)
  * [Independent Set](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_p)
  * [Gold - Barn Painting](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=766)
    * Similar to Independent Set
  * [Gold - Delegation](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1019)
    * Good rule of solving DP problems applies here: don't just dive into trying to figure out a DP state and transitions, and make some observations about the problem first.
