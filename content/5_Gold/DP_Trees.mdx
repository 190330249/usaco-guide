  * [NOI PDF (Philippines)](https://noi.ph/training/weekly/week5.pdf) 

## Problems

<info-block title="Pro Tip">

Don't just dive into trying to figure out a DP state and transitions -- make some observations if you don't see any obvious DP solution!

      - Similar to Independent Set
    - [Gold - Delegation](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1019)
      - Pretty much a greedy problem.

      - Observations first.

      - Solve child subtree by subtree. Runtime may be faster than you think.
