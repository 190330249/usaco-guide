## Problems

<info-block title="Pro Tip">

Don't just dive into trying to figure out a DP state and transitions -- make some observations if you don't see any obvious DP solution!

      - Similar to Independent Set

      - Pretty much a greedy problem.

      - Solve child subtree by subtree. Runtime may be faster than you think.
