(actually figure out what makes a dif on USACO lol)

## C++

(using scanf, printf instead?)

(not using endl?)

Including `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` in the main function can speed up input & output significantly on some tasks. See [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/5217) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31162367/significance-of-ios-basesync-with-stdiofalse-cin-tienull) for more information. 

 - Actually, the former link says that it is supposedly prohibited to use `freopen` to redirect `cin` and `cout` if `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);` is included, but it works properly as far as I know.
