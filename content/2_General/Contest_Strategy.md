The best contest strategy is to go in knowing everything. However, only few people can do this (see [BenQ](https://codeforces.com/profile/benq) or [TMW](https://codeforces.com/profile/tmwilliamlin168)) (I kid). Once the timer starts, there's no more studying you can do, and managing your time wisely is the best thing you can do to maximize your score.

## Scenarios

### When there are partials
If you can get points from partially solving a problem (e.g. in USACO), then it's a good idea to keep them in mind. There are two approaches to partially solving problems.
- Think about the problem with full constraints, then code the partials if you haven't found the solution and your time is about to run out. Be careful about this, as it could take anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes to code a partial depending on the details!
- Work up from the partials, coding the easiest and then going to the hardest. The partial subtasks may help you think of the full solution, and will also help you stay on track; sometimes when going straight for full points, you can make a whole program before realizing your idea was totally wrong.
