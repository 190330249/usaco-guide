> Hello, Which online judge should I practice more to do well in **IOI**?

> The closest OJ for IOI style?

[oj.uz](https://oj.uz/) is a great online judge that has most of the Olympiad problems that you'll probably want to solve. However, other great online judges with different Olympiad problems exist.

The [OI Checklist](https://oichecklist.pythonanywhere.com/) is a great way to track your progress.

Here is a list of major (inter)national Olympiads and the online judges where you can solve problems from them:

## [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/)

- Older Problems
  - [TJ website](http://tjsct.wikidot.com/usaco/)
  - [Korean website to submit ...](https://www.acmicpc.net/category/106)
- [USACO Training](http://train.usaco.org/usacogate)
  - Legacy training system
  - Does not contain some recent topics (e.g. segment tree)

<!--
- [Article](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/bodinfo/bod/bodmarch10/future.pdf)
  - an interesting read ... -->

<!-- Quotes: -->
<!--
> USACO thus faces a dilemma: should USACO continue to train the world and expose all its best pedagogical technologies to students from all different countries? Should USACO keep the best techniques secret just for US students? -->

<!-- > Training and competition paradigms which attract and reward loners rather than encouraging collaboration and socialization ... Their conversations at training camp concern algorithms and mathematics ... and little else. Generally (with a few notable exceptions), they would not be viewed as well-balanced or particularly socially adept in their interactions with adults and as observed by adults at camp and on trips.
