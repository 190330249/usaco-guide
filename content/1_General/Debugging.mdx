## Printing Variables

### Basic Print Statements

The most basic way that you might debug is adding a print statement. This is great and serves the purpose for the most part. For instance, we can write the below to check the value of `x` at a point in our code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int x = 10; // some important variable

inline void dbg() { cout << "x is " << x << "\n"; }

int main() {
    dbg();
    x = 5000;
    dbg();
}
```

Such print statements are great on a basic level, and we can comment or define them out of our main code when we need to compile and execute a more final version of our code.

However, as great as print statements are, they are annoying to work with and efficiently separate from the actual parts of our code. This is important for example when we want an online judge \(OJ\) to read our output.

### Standard Error Stream

The standard error stream \(`cerr` in C++\) is a quick fix to this. Instead of printing in standard iostream, we actually generate a whole new stream of data called the error stream. Simply replace all instances of `cout` with `cerr`. For example:

```cpp
inline void dbg() { cerr << "x is " << x << "\n"; }

int main() {
    dbg();
    x = 5000;
    dbg();
}
```

Try running this program and you might be confused about the difference. You will be able to see the output of `cerr` right next to regular `cout` outputs. But this is the beauty of it! And if we use freopen to open up file pipes or submit this to an OJ, the program will not include the error stream.

<Warning>

Printing too much content to `stderr` can still cause TLE when submitting to an OJ.

</Warning>

### Debug Template

Although not feasible if you have to write all code from scratch, [this template](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/content/contest/CppIO.h) is very helpful for simplifying input / output / debug output. Note that `dbg()` only produces debug output when `-DLOCAL` is included as part of the compilation command, so you don't need to comment out those lines before submitting.

[Examples - Debug Output](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/content/contest/CppIO_test.cpp)

<Warning>
	You are not allowed to use pre-written code for USACO contests, so `dbg()`
	should only be used for other online contests.

## Stress Testing

If your code is getting WA, one option is to run your buggy code against another that you're relatively confident is correct on randomly generated data until you find a difference. See the video for details.

Script that was mentioned in video:

```
# A and B are executables you want to compare, gen takes int
# as command line arg. Usage: 'sh stress.sh'
for((i = 1; ; ++i)); do # if they are same then will loop forever
    echo $i
    ./gen $i > int
    ./A < int > out1
    ./B < int > out2
    diff -w out1 out2 || break
    # diff -w <(./A < int) <(./B < int) || break
done
```

If you have the input and output files (ex. `1.in`, `1.out`, `2.in`, `2.out`, ..., `10.out` for old USACO problems) then you can use the following instead.

```
# A is executable you want to test
for((i = 1; i <= 10; ++i)); do
    echo $i
    ./A < $i.in > out
    diff -w out $i.out || break
done
echo "ALL TESTS PASSED"
```

In Errichto's blog he says that he uses the following as part of his compilation command:

```
-fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=address -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG -g
```

<Warning title="Disclaimer">

Ben - I don't use this on a regular basis, there are probably better sources to learn about these.

</Warning>

Let's give some examples of what each of these do.

<Warning>
	
These can significantly slow down runtime.

### `-fsanitize=undefined`

The following `prog.cpp` gives a segmentation fault.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> v;
    cout << v[-1];
}
```

`g++ prog.cpp -o prog -fsanitize=undefined && ./prog` produces:

```
/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/9.2.0_1/include/c++/9.2.0/bits/stl_vector.h:1043:34: runtime error: pointer index expression with base 0x000000000000 overflowed to 0xfffffffffffffffc
zsh: segmentation fault  ./prog
```

Another example with `prog.cpp` as the following:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int v[5];
	cout << v[5];
}
```

`g++ prog.cpp -o prog -fsanitize=undefined && ./prog` produces:

```
prog.cpp:6:13: runtime error: index 5 out of bounds for type 'int [5]'
prog.cpp:6:13: runtime error: load of address 0x7ffee0a77a94 with insufficient space for an object of type 'int'

              ^
```

`-fsanitize=undefined` also catches integer overflow. Let `prog.cpp` be the following:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int x = 1<<30;
	cout << x+x;
}
```

`g++ prog.cpp -o prog -fsanitize=undefined && ./prog` produces:

```
prog.cpp:6:15: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 1073741824 * 2 cannot be represented in type 'int'
```

### `-fsanitize=address`

For more helpful information we should additionally compile with the `-ggdb` flag. `-ggdb` generates a debug report (in dSYM file format) based on the line numbering of the program. `-fsanitize=address` can then access the dSYM file at runtime and give meaningful errors. This is great because it helps diagnose (or "sanitize" if you will) errors such as out of bounds, exceptions, and segmentation faults, even indicating precise line numbers. Feel free to delete dSYM files after the run of course.

## Debuggers

<Resources>

Using a debugger varies from language to language and even IDE to different IDE. For now I will describe the basic operations of a debugger.

A debugger allows you to pause a code in its execution and see the values as a given point in the debugger.

To do this, set a "breakpoint" at a certain line of code. When the code runs to that breakpoint, it will pause and you will be able to inspect all the different variables at that certain instance.

There are two more useful and common operations. Once you are at the breakpoint, you may want to see what happens after the current line is executed. This would be the "Step Over" button that will allow you to move to the next line. Say you are at a line with the following code: `dfs(0,-1)`, if you click "step over" the debugger will ignore showing you what happens in this function and go to the next line. If you click "step in," however, you will enter the function and be able to step through that function.

In essense, a debugger is a tool to "trace code" for you. It is not much different from just printing the values out at various points in your program.

Pros of using a debugger:

- No need to write print statements so you save time
- You can step through the code in real time

Cons of using a debugger:

- You cannot see the overall "output" of your program at each stage. For example, if I wanted to see every single value of `i` in the program, I could not using a debugger.
- Most advanced competitive programmers do not use debuggers; it is quite time inefficient.

## Rewriting the Program

Rewriting the program is sometimes a good idea, but remember to keep track of time! It is very easy to get carried away rewriting even parts of a program that are bug-free in obsessive hope that something might come through.

<Warning>

Do NOT delete your previous program. Make a new file! It's always possible that you might introduce more bugs.

</Warning>

If the problem is with the program's implementation of your logic and not your logic itself, it is usually better to fix the program directly.
