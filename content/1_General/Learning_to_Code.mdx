## Computational Problem-Solving Before Learning to Code

Even before you have mastered coding, there are good resources out there for learning about algorithms and computational problem-solving. An excellent example is the [Bebras contest](https://www.bebras.org/), with questions that make you think algorithmically but with no coding required. This contest has been highly successful overseas (with hundreds of thousands of students participating), and a [USA version](https://www.bebraschallenge.org/) has recently been established. Also see [CS unplugged](https://csunplugged.org/en/) for another set of resources that teaches computing concepts but without programming.

## Learning to Code - General

There are now quite a few high-quality on-line resources available for helping you get started with coding in general (not necessarily with the same algorithmic focus as USACO). Good general lists of resources are maintained by [code.org](https://code.org/learn), [Facebook](https://techprep.org/), and [IT-ology](https://www.it-ology.org/it-resources/k-12-resources/). Some of the most popular novice programming environments are graphical "block-based" languages like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) (for coding Android cell phone apps), where you write programs by dragging blocks together. Other prominent sites that help teach introductory programming are [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming).

## Learning to Code - USACO

Let us know what works (or doesn't) for you.

### General

	<Resource title="Sololearn" url="https://www.sololearn.com/" starred>
		free courses for C++, Java, Python
	</Resource>
	<Resource title="Codecademy" url="https://www.codecademy.com/">
		free courses for C++, Java, Python 2, some features require upgrading to pro
	</Resource>
	<Resource

	>
		generally ok, although CSES problemset (see "Resources") is probably a
		better place to start than USACO Training or Codechef

### C++

Use one of the resources above or below (or find your own) to learn C++. If you use Sololearn, you don't have to complete the full course; we recommend you finish everything up to (and including) "Functions."

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="CPP"
		title="C++ Language Tutorial"
		url="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/" starred
	>
		Good introduction.
	</Resource>
	<Resource source="LCPP" title="Learn C++" url="https://www.learncpp.com/" starred>
		More in-depth than the above. Detailed instructions for Visual Studio 
		Community (Windows) and Code::Blocks (Windows, Linux) setup.
	</Resource>
	<Resource source="PAPS" title="2 - Programming in C++">
		Visual Studio Code setup (Windows, Linux, Mac), examples, Kattis
		exercises
	</Resource>
</Resources>

<Info title="Pro Tip">

Pointers aren't necessary for earlier divisions. Knowledge of structs and classes is useful but not required.
