This page contains pointers to on-line resources that might be helpful for our participants. These links are provided for convenience only; USACO does not officially endorse or promote any of these sites or programs.

Additionally, be sure to check out the [Contests](/general/contests) page for more algorithmic programming contests!

## Computational Problem-Solving Before Learning to Code

Even before you have mastered coding, there are good resources out there for learning about algorithms and computational problem-solving. An excellent example is the [Bebras contest](https://www.bebras.org/), with questions that make you think algorithmically but with no coding required. This contest has been highly successful overseas (with hundreds of thousands of students participating), and a [USA version](https://www.bebraschallenge.org/) has recently been established. Also see [CS unplugged](https://csunplugged.org/en/) for another set of resources that teaches computing concepts but without programming.

## Learning to Code

There are now quite a few high-quality on-line resources available for helping you get started with coding in general (not necessarily with the same algorithmic focus as USACO). Good general lists of resources are maintained by [code.org](https://code.org/learn), [Facebook](https://techprep.org/), and [IT-ology](https://www.it-ology.org/it-resources/k-12-resources/). Some of the most popular novice programming environments are graphical "block-based" languages like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) (for coding Android cell phone apps), where you write programs by dragging blocks together. Other prominent sites that help teach introductory programming are [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming).

## Other Camps and Courses in the USA

There are of course many different computing camps and programs available for high-school students in different regions of the USA, but not so many tend to focus on algorithmic problem-solving. Some notable examples of programs that do focus on algorithmic problem solving include a new 2-week summer programming training camp for high-school students at the University of Central Florida, aimed at students who want to excel in programming contests like the USACO ([details](http://siucf.cs.ucf.edu/programming-competition-overview/)). In the Orange County Area (also in the Bay Area and online), [Star League](https://starleague.us/index.php/courses/a-star-computer-sciences), in the Bay Area, [Alpha Star Academy](https://alphastar.academy/) and [Ascende Learning](https://ascendelearning.com/), and in Northern Virginia, [Absolute Academy](https://www.absoluteacademy.net/) offer courses based on the USACO curriculum. Prof. Rajiv Gandhi organizes a [Program on Algorithmic Thinking](http://algorithmicthinking.org/) at Princeton University that provides summer program for high-school students interested in theoretical computer science. The [KTBYTE](https://www.ktbyte.com/) program offers relevant classes in Massachusetts and also online. An organization called "Stem Ivy" offers online [courses](http://usacocoach.com) geared towards USACO training.

## USA Participation in Other International Olympiads

The USACO is one of several national organizations in the USA that select teams of students to participate in their respective International Science Olympiads. The most prominent are the [USA Mathematics Olympiad (USAMO)](http://amc.maa.org/usamo/usamo.shtml), the [US Physics Team](http://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/program.cfm) , the [US National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO)](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/olympiad.html) , and the [USA Biolympiad (USABO)](http://www.usabo-trc.org).
