## Computational Problem-Solving Before Learning to Code

Even before you have mastered coding, there are good resources out there for learning about algorithms and computational problem-solving. An excellent example is the [Bebras contest](https://www.bebras.org/), with questions that make you think algorithmically but with no coding required. This contest has been highly successful overseas (with hundreds of thousands of students participating), and a [USA version](https://www.bebraschallenge.org/) has recently been established. Also see [CS unplugged](https://csunplugged.org/en/) for another set of resources that teaches computing concepts but without programming.

## Learning to Code

There are now quite a few high-quality on-line resources available for helping you get started with coding in general (not necessarily with the same algorithmic focus as USACO). Good general lists of resources are maintained by [code.org](https://code.org/learn), [Facebook](https://techprep.org/), and [IT-ology](https://www.it-ology.org/it-resources/k-12-resources/). Some of the most popular novice programming environments are graphical "block-based" languages like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [AppInventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) (for coding Android cell phone apps), where you write programs by dragging blocks together. Other prominent sites that help teach introductory programming are [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming).
