## Ways to Contribute

We welcome any and all contributions to this site! Please use the "Contact Us" form to get started and mention **what specifically you intend to contribute**. Some examples:

### Lesson

- Convert lists of resources to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Add missing descriptions for sections, modules, or resources.
  - All resources should have descriptions.
- Improve explanations for sample problems.
  - If starred resource or editorial already has a good explanation, no need to repeat it.
- Improve implementations.
  - Include code handling input & output.
  - Should be consistent across languages.
- Adding modules!

### Problems

- Convert lists of problems to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Fix problem difficulties and tags.
- Add problems that are good examples of the module topic (and remove those that are not).
- Adding official editorial links.
  - Those for USACO are automatically generated.
  - Don't link CF if it's already included in "Contest Materials."
- Adding editorials.
  - If no editorial exists, or if existing editorial could be improved.
