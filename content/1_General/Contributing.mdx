All modules are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown + JSX), with
limited $\LaTeX$ support from [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and some custom
components. You can check how an `.mdx` file renders by pasting it in the
[live editor](/editor). If you are confused about something, or if there's a
certain feature that you want to add, reach out to Nathan Wang.

## Quick Start

The USACO Guide has a public
[Github Repository](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/issues). Feel
free to contribute by submitting issues and pull requests!

### Using the Editor (recommended)

The easiest way to edit content is to use our live [editor](/liveupdate).

### Running Site Locally

You can also run a local version of the site in order to view your changes. This
is useful if you need to use Tailwind CSS classes, which don't work with
`/editor`.

1. Set up your development environment.
   - Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
     - [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system)
   - Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
     - `npm install -g yarn`? might work
2. Clone repo
   - Via command line:
     `git clone https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide.git`
   - Or use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Install Dependencies
   - `yarn`
4. Run development server
   - `yarn develop`

## Ways to Contribute

Some examples:

## Writing Content

See the
[Content Documentation](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/docs/Content%20Documentation.md)
for more info.

### Lesson

- Convert lists of resources to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Add missing descriptions for sections, modules, or resources.
  - All resources should have descriptions.
- Improve explanations for sample problems.
  - If starred resource or editorial already has a good explanation, no need to
    repeat it.
- Improve implementations.
  - Include code handling input & output.
  - Should be consistent across languages.
- Adding modules!

### Problems

- Convert lists of problems to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Fix problem difficulties and tags.
- Add problems that are good examples of the module topic (and remove those that
  are not).
- Adding official editorial links.
  - Those for USACO are automatically generated.
- Adding editorials.
  - If no editorial exists, or if existing editorial could be improved.
  - Or solution code in a different language, etc.
