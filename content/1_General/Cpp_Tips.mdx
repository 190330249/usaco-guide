You are not allowed to use pre-written code for USACO contests, so you need to type out any code you use during the contest.

## `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`

You can use `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` in place of separately including libraries.

### Usage

This is usable with [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection). However, Mac OS X uses [Clang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang) while Windows uses [Microsoft Visual C++ (MVSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B) by default. `<bits/stdc++.h>` is **not** a standard header file, so it will not work with the latter two. This is one of the reasons why you should **not** use `<bits/stdc++.h>` outside of competitive programming.

If you installed GCC as mentioned in [Running Code](/general/running-code#installing-gcc), then you should be good to go.

### Using Without Installing GCC

If you installed Clang on Mac, then you can download `stdc++.h` from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tekfyl/bits-stdc-.h-for-mac/master/stdc%2B%2B.h) and move it into a folder named `bits` that is located in the same directory as where all other C++ header files are located. However, this is not recommended.

## Macros

Introduced in [Writing Generic Code](/general/generic).

### Pairs

```cpp
typedef pair<int,int> pi;
#define mp make_pair
#define f first
#define s second
```

Pretty annoying to keep typing `first` and `second` (especially if you have nested pairs ...)

### Vectors

```cpp
typedef vector<int> vi;
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
```

It's generally a good idea to convert a size to a signed integer before doing anything with it to avoid cases like the following.

```cpp
vi x;
cout << x.size()-1 << "\n"; // 18446744073709551615
cout << sz(x)-1 << "\n"; // -1
```

`all(v)` makes sorting part or all of a vector a bit shorter.

```cpp
vi v = {2,4,1,5,3};
sort(1+all(v)); // {2,1,3,4,5}
sort(all(v)); // {1,2,3,4,5}
```

## Constants

```cpp
const int MOD = 1e9+7; // 998244353;
const int MX = 2e5+5;
const ll INF = 1e18;
const ld PI = acos((ld)-1);
```

$10^9+7$ is a prime that appears quite frequently in programming contests. Interestingly, $(10^9+7-1)/2=5\cdot 10^8+3$ is also prime. On the other hand, $998244353-1$ is divisible by $2^{23}$, which is useful for [NTT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform_(general)#Number-theoretic_transform>).

Almost all USACO problems satisfy $N\le 2\cdot 10^5$, so that's what `MX` is for.

## Generating Random Numbers

```cpp
mt19937 rng((uint32_t)chrono::steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count());
```

See [neal's blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/61587) about why `rand()` is bad. Use `rng()` instead.

## Generating Sublime Snippets

I use [this python script](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/content/contest/makeSnip.py) to automatically update snippets for all of my templates.

Instructions (Mac):

1. Install `python3`.
2. Clone [my USACO repository](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO) to `~/Documents/USACO`.
3. Add the following to your `~/.zshenv`.


    ```
    export USACO=~/Documents/USACO
    makeSnip() {
      cd $USACO/Implementations/content/contest
      python3 genShort.py
      python3 genLong.py
      python3 $USACO/Contests/Tools/Other/makeSnip.py
    }
    ```

4. Run `makeSnip` from terminal. It should display a list of the templates that will be added as snippets.
5. If this succeeded, then typing `Temp` in a cpp file will automatically load my template!

<Info title = "Pro Tip">
Instead of copy pasting algorithms into snippets, it's a good idea to write the algorithm yourself first. Knowing how to write the algorithm is not only important because you can't use snippets in USACO contests, but also helps your understanding of the algorithm!

Anything more beginner-friendly?

### Recursive Lambdas

If we add the following from the link above in C++14:

```cpp
namespace std {

template<class Fun>
class y_combinator_result {
  Fun fun_;
public:
  template<class T>
  explicit y_combinator_result(T &&fun): fun_(std::forward<T>(fun)) {}

  template<class ...Args>
  decltype(auto) operator()(Args &&...args) {
    return fun_(std::ref(*this), std::forward<Args>(args)...);
  }
};

template<class Fun>
decltype(auto) y_combinator(Fun &&fun) {
  return y_combinator_result<std::decay_t<Fun>>(std::forward<Fun>(fun));
}

} // namespace std
```

Then we can have code like the following!

```cpp
int main() {
  cout << y_combinator([](auto gcd, int a, int b) -> int {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
  })(20,30) << "\n"; // outputs 10
}
```

Looks like [ecnerwal](https://codeforces.com/contest/1375/submission/86008510) uses these a lot.
