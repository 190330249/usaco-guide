title: When to Read Editorials

Knowing when to "give up" on a problem and start reading the problem's editorial
is challenging. Below are the opinions of various individuals.

Note that "give up" is in quotes, because one still learns when they "give up"
and read an editorial!

My personal opinion is that it is okay to give up early when solving CP problems.
Sometimes I spend as little as 15-20 minutes on a problem before reading the editorial
or at least glancing at solution code. Other times I may spend significantly longer.

CP editorials generally aren't the best (with the exception of USACO editorials,
which are pretty good) so I often spend a lot of time trying to understand the
solution even after "giving up" and reading the editorial. I think it's good
enough to implement the code without having the editorial open.

My justification for why I think it's okay to give up so early is as follows:

- Getting frustrated and quitting CP for a week is worse than giving up
  - Whenever I feel like I'm really frustrated with a problem, I read the editorial
- CP editorials are usually difficult to understand, so you will still have
  to spend a lot of time reading and understanding them
- You learn a _lot_ by reading editorials
- If you can solve a problem without reading the editorial, that means you
  probably could have solved the problem in-contest too, so you didn't actually
  learn that much. However, if you didn't know how to solve a problem and
  you read the editorial so now you do, then you've learned a lot more.
  - In other words, reading editorials is a _good_ thing, not a bad thing!

Overall, I would just say to "give up" when you feel like giving up, whether that's
in five hours or in 15 minutes :)

Read the editorial when you feel like you've stopped making progress; that could be from 1 to 5 hours. However, the most important part about reading the editorial is that you understand the topic and try to think about what similar problems look like. Being generally curious is a good way to practice algorithmic thinking.
