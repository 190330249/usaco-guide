Here's what you should learn before reading these resources.

<!-- END DESCRIPTION -->
 
These resources do not teach you how to code. We recommend you learn roughly the first half of AP Computer Science A before continuing. If you do not meet these prerequisites, you can go to the resources below to get started.

Expected Knowledge:

- Variables
  - Data types
- Reading Input
- Writing Output
- Loops
- If/else
- Logical operators
- Functions
  - Basic Recursion (a function calling itself)
- Arrays
  - Multidimensional Arrays

## Resources for Learning to Code

[Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) has courses on C++, Java, and Python. You don't have to complete the full course.

- For C++, we recommend you finish Sololearn up to (but not including) "More on Classes."

## Using C++

You do not need to learn pointers (for now). Knowledge of structs and classes is useful but not required.

Here's a basic C++ template you may find useful:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // these two lines open the file into the standard input/output,
    // so you can just use cin/cout.
    freopen("file.in", "r", stdin);
    freopen("file.out", "w", stdout);

    // Code goes here!!

    return 0;
}
```
