<optional-content title="Range Update and Range Query in Higher Dimensions">

You can extend the 1D BIT solution for range update range query to higher dimensions as well

### Offline


Suppose that you want to update and query with $N\approx 10^5$ points. 

 - The 2D BITs mentioned above use $O(N^2)$ memory, which is too much.
 - Can be reduced to $O(N\log^2N)$ memory with unordered map, but this might also be too much (and too slow).
 - If you know the points to be updated beforehand then you can reduce to $O(N\log N)$ memory (and no maps).

The intended complexity is $O(N\log^2 N)$. Two options:

  - compressed 2D BIT
    - rather difficult to pass within time and memory limits
      - Make sure to use `\n` instead of `endl`!

  - divide & conquer with a 1D BIT

## 2D Segment Tree

Note: no lazy propagation in 2D.

### Short Description

  - CSES 28.2 (Sparse Segment Tree), 28.4
  - Segment Tree (or BIT) nested inside segment tree
  - use 2D offline BIT instead whenever possible (faster, lower memory)

    - good implementation?
