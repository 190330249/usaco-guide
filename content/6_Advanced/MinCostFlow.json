These are the only nodes with costs. Each 'exit' node points to to next 'exit' node of the same value, and also point to the 3rd layer. The 3rd layer tracks modulos, and points to the next layer 3 node with the same modulo. Every entrance node has at most 3 in-edges: from the closest +1 exit node, the closest -1 exit node, and the closest layer 3 node with the same modulo. Overall a graph with $approx 3N$ nodes and $approx 9N$ edges.",
