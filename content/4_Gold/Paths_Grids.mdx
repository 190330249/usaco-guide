## Tutorial

</Resources>

A common archetype of DP Problems involves a 2D grid of square cells (like graph paper), and we have to analyze "paths" which have these properties:

 - A path is a sequence of cells whose movement is restricted to one direction on the x-axis and one direction on the y-axis (e.g. You may only move down or to the right).
 - Usually these paths have to go from one corner of the grid to another corner of the grid.
 - These paths will also have to satisfy other interesting properties defined by the problem.

The problem may ask you to count the number of paths that satisfy some property, or it may ask you to find the max/min of some quantity over all paths.

Usually, the DP-state for grid problems will include at least two numbers: the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. For some problems, it might be more convenient to think of x and y as the column and the row respectively. 

## Solution - Paths on a Grid

In this problem, we are directly given a 2D grid of cells, and we have to count the number of paths that satisfy most of the aforementioned properties. The path must move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, it can only travel down or to the right, and it has an interesting problem-specific property: it can't use a cell marked with an asterik.

(an explanation to be added)

(probably want a piece-wise function to represent this)

$DP[x][y] = DP[x-1][y] {if (x-1, y) is not a trap} + DP(x, y-1) {if (x, y-1) is not a trap}$

## Solution - Longest Common Subsequence

The longest common subsequence is a classical string problem which has no grid, but we can analyze it with a grid to solve it. 

Imagine one axis has the letters of the first string written along it, and the other axis has the letters of the second string written along it. A common subsequence can be modeled as a path ... (to be added)
