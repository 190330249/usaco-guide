## What Now?

After completing this section on the USACO Guide, you should be comfortable with
the topics that have historically appeared in the USACO Gold
division.<Asterisk>Of course, there's always a chance that another topic,
potentially from a higher division, will show up in future Gold
contests.</Asterisk> In order to maximize your chance at promoting, you should
aim to **practice** by doing more problems.

## Uncategorized Problems

Below we list some problems that we think are roughly Gold level but don't
really fit in previous modules.<Asterisk>either due to too many problems or
because it requires more than one concept</Asterisk> The difficulties listed
here are relative to the Gold division (difficulty is subjective and isn't
always accurate though).

// todo: massive problems list

## Where to find more problems

1. Old USACO problems -- We provide a list of recent USACO problems
   [here](https://usaco.guide/general/usaco-monthlies). You can also find even
   older USACO problems on the [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/) website. Note that
   older USACO problems may be easier than recent USACO contest problems due to
   increases in difficulty.
2. [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) -- you can search by tag, difficulty
   level, etc. For a _rough_ guideline of CodeForces rating to USACO division
   mapping, check out
   [our FAQ page](https://usaco.guide/usaco-faq/#q-what-codeforces-rating-corresponds-to-each-of-the-usaco-divisions).
3. [CSAcademy Archive](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/)
4. [Other contests](https://usaco.guide/general/contests) that you may want to
   participate in

## Final Thoughts

You may find the [How to Practice](https://usaco.guide/general/practicing) module worth reading. Best of luck on future contests!
