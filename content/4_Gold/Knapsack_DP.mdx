Knapsack problems generally involve filling a limited "container" with items, and we want to count or maximize some quantity. Almost every time, you can think of each item as having a nonnegative integer "weight", and the total weight of the subset of items we choose must not exceed the capacity of the container, which is another nonnegative integer. Some variations of knapsack-type problems include:

- [The 0/1 Knapsack problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/): Choosing a subset of items such that we maximize their total value and their total weight does not exceed the capacity of the container
- Finding all the possible total weights that we can achieve using the given items (in the chapter of CPH linked above)
- Counting how many ways there are to fill the container completely (the order in which the items are placed in the container may or may not matter)

The DP solution to knapsack problems usually involve the current capacity of the knapsack in the state, and the transitions involve trying to add an item to the knapsack. In competitive programming, you can expect that classical knapsack problems will be given twists, disguises, and extra state information involved. 
<!-- Common variations on Knapsack, followed by more challenging problems which feature variations on the state and additional algorithms. -->

### Solution

The problem asks us how many sequences of dice rolls exist such that sum of the top faces is $N (N \leq 10^6)$. To keep up with the knapsack analogy, that means we have infinite items of sizes $1$ through $6$ at our disposal, and we want to count how many sequences of items exist such that if we put items into a container of size $N$ in that order, the container becomes completely full. Note that the order of the items matters in this problem.

To count how many sequences add up to $N$, let's look at the last dice roll that brings us to total sum $N$. For convenience, denote $dp(x)$ to be the number of sequences of dice rolls that add up to $x$. If the last roll was a $1$, then we know there are $dp(N-1)$ ways to achieve sum $N$ when the last roll is $1$. If the last roll was a $2$, then we know there are $dp(N-2)$ ways to achieve sum $N$ when the last roll is $2$. Continue this logic for all the dice numbers up to $6$. Then, we can add up those cases to come up with our recurrence:

$dp(N) = dp(N-1) + dp(N-2) + dp(N-3) + dp(N-4) + dp(N-5) + dp(N-6)$.

Start with the base case that $dp(0) = 1$, and then the rest of the DP values can be computed in increasing order using the recurrence above. Keep in mind that $dp(x)$ isn't defined for negative values of x.

typedef long long ll;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	
	ll dp[n+1];
	dp[0] = 1;
	for(int i = 1; i<= n; i++) dp[i] = 0;
	for(int i = 1; i<= n; i++) {
		for(int j = 1; j <= 6; j++) {
			if(i-j >= 0) {
				dp[i] += dp[i-j];
				dp[i] %= 1000000007;
			}
		}
	}

	cout << dp[n] << "\n";

	return 0;
}
