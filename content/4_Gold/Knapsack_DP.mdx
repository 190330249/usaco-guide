Knapsack problems generally involve filling a limited \"container\" with items, and we want to count or maximize some quantity. Almost every time, you can think of each item as having a nonnegative integer \"weight\", and the total weight of the subset of items we choose must not exceed the capacity of the container, which is another nonnegative integer. Some variations of knapsack-type problems include:
- [The 0/1 Knapsack problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/): Choosing a subset of items such that we maximize their total value and their total weight does not exceed the capacity of the container
- Finding all the possible total weights that we can achieve using the given items (in the chapter of CPH linked above)
- Counting how many ways there are to fill the container completely (the order in which the items are placed in the container may or may not matter)

In competitive programming, you can expect that classical knapsack problems will be given twists, disguises, and extra state information involved. 
<!-- Common variations on Knapsack, followed by more challenging problems which feature variations on the state and additional algorithms. -->
