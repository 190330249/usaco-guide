In many problems (especially in Bronze) it suffices to check all possible cases in the solution space, whether it be all elements, all pairs of elements, or all subsets, or all permutations. Unsurprisingly, this is called **complete search** (or **brute force**), because it completely searches the entire solution space.

## Example

You are given $N$ $(3 \leq N \leq 5000)$ integer points on the coordinate plane. Find the square of the maximum Euclidean distance (aka length of the straight line) between any two of the points.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer $N$.

The second line contains $N$ integers, the $x$-coordinates of the points: $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N$ ($-1000 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $N$ integers, the $y$-coordinates of the poitnts: $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_N$ ($-1000 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).

### Output Format

Print one integer, the square of the maximum Euclidean distance between any two of the points.

<Spoiler title="Solution">

We can brute-force every pair of points and find the square of the distance between them, by squaring the formula for Euclidean distance: $\text{distance}^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2$. Thus, we store the coordinates in arrays `X[]` and `Y[]`, such that `X[i]` and `Y[i]` are the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the $i_{th}$ point, respectively. Then, we iterate through all possible pairs of points, using a variable max to store the maximum square of distance between any pair seen so far, and if the square of the distance between a pair is greater than our current maximum, we set our current maximum to it.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
int high = 0; // storing the current maximum
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){ // for each first point
    for(int j = i+1; j < n; j++){ // for each second point
        int dx = x[i] - x[j];
        int dy = y[i] - y[j];
        high = max(high, dx*dx + dy*dy);
        // if the square of the distance between the two points is greater than
        // our current maximum, then update the maximum
    }
}
cout << high << endl;
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
int max = 0; // storing the current maximum
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){ // for each first point
    for(int j = i+1; j < n; j++){ // for each second point
        int dx = x[i] - x[j];
        int dy = y[i] - y[j];
        max = Math.max(max, dx*dx + dy*dy);
        // if the square of the distance between the two points is greater than
        // our current maximum, then update the maximum
    }
}
pw.println(max);
```

</JavaSection>

</LanguageSection>

<br />

A couple notes:

  - First, since we're iterating through all pairs of points, we start the $j$ loop from $j = i+1$ so that point $i$ and point $j$ are never the same point. Furthermore, it makes it so that each pair is only counted once. In this problem, it doesn't matter whether we double-count pairs or whether we allow $i$ and $j$ to be the same point, but in other problems where we're counting something rather than looking at the maximum, it's important to be careful that we don't overcount.
  - Secondly, the problem asks for the square of the maximum Euclidean distance between any two points. Some students may be tempted to maintain the maximum distance in an integer variable, and then square it at the end when outputting. However, the problem here is that while the square of the distance between two integer points is always an integer, the distance itself isn't guaranteed to be an integer. Thus, we'll end up shoving a non-integer value into an integer variable, which truncates the decimal part. Using a floating point variable will probably work, but you should generally stay with integers whenever possible.

## Generating Permutations

<Problems problems={problems.permSam} />

<br />

A **permutation** is a reordering of a list of elements. Some problems will ask for an ordering of elements that satisfies certain conditions. In these problems, if $N \leq 10$, we can complete search through all permutations and check each permutation for validity. For a list of $N$ elements, there are $N!$ ways to permute them, and generally we'll need to read through each permutation once to check its validity, for a time complexity of $O(N \cdot N!)$.

### Lexicographical Order

This term is mentioned quite frequently:

<Problems problems={problems.ex} />

Think about how are words ordered in a dictionary. (In fact, this is where the term "lexicographical" comes from.)

In dictionaries, you will see that words beginning with the letter 'a' appears at the very beginning, followed by words beginning with 'b', and so on. If two words have the same starting letter, the second letter is used to compare them; if both the first and second letters are the same, then use the third letter to compare them, and so on until we either reach a letter that is different, or we reach the end of some word (in this case, the shorter word goes first).

Permutations can be placed into lexicographical order in almost the same way. We first group permutations by their first element; if the first element of two permutations are equal, then we compare them by the second element; if the second element is also equal, then we compare by the third element, and so on.

For example, the permutations of 3 elements, in lexicographical order, are 

$$
[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
$$ 

Notice that the list starts with permutations beginning with 1 (just like a dictionary that starts with words beginning with 'a'), followed by those beginning with 2 and those beginning with 3. Within the same starting element, the second element is used to make comparisions.

Generally, unless you are specifically asked to find the lexicographically smallest/largest solution, you do not need to worry about whether permutations are being generated in lexicographical order. However, the idea of lexicographical order does appear quite often in programming contest problems, and in a variety of contexts, so it is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with its definition.

### Checking Permutations in Lexicographical Order 

What's going to be in the `check` function depends on the problem, but it should verify whether the current permutation satisfies the constraints given in the problem.

#### Method 2

</Resources>

Alternatively, we can just use the [`next_permutation()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation) function. This function takes in a range and modifies it to the next greater permutation. If there is no greater permutation, it returns false. To iterate through all permutations, place it inside a `do-while` loop. We are using a `do-while` loop here instead of a typical `while` loop because a `while` loop would modify the smallest permutation before we got a chance to process it.

```cpp
do {
  check(v); // process or check the current permutation for validity
} while(next_permutation(v.begin(), v.end()));
```

Each call to `next_permutation` makes a constant number of swaps on average if we go through all $N!$ permutations of size $N$.

      check(cur); // check current permutation for validity, or print it, etc.
      return;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) if (!used[i]) {
      used[i] = true; cur.add(i+1);
      gen();
      used[i] = false; cur.remove(cur.size()-1);
