Both Java and C++ contain two versions of sets and maps; one using **sorting** and the other using **hashing**. We'll only introduce the former version in this module.


## Sets

<Problems problems={problems.dis} />

A **set** is a collection of objects that contains no duplicates. In ordered sets, the entries are sorted in order of key. Insertions, deletions, and searches are all $O(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of elements in the set.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

The operations on a C++ [`set`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) include:

 - `insert`, which adds an element to the set if not already present.
 - `erase`, which deletes an element if it exists.
 - `count`, which returns `1` if the set contains the element and `0` if it doesn't.

```cpp
set<int> s;
s.insert(1); // [1]
s.insert(4); // [1, 4]
s.insert(2); // [1, 2, 4]
s.insert(1); // [1, 2, 4]
// the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
cout << s.count(1) << endl; // 1
s.erase(1); // [2, 4]
cout << s.count(5) << endl; // 0
s.erase(0); // [2, 4]
// if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens

for (int element : s) {
    cout << element << " ";
}
cout << endl;
// You can iterate through an set in sorted order
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

The operations on a `TreeSet` are `add`, which adds an element to the set if not already present, `remove`, which deletes an element if it exists, and `contains`, which checks whether the set contains that element.

```java
Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<Integer>();
set.add(1); // [1]
set.add(4); // [1, 4] 
set.add(2); // [1, 2, 4]
set.add(1); // [1, 2, 4]
// the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
System.out.println(set.contains(1)); // true
set.remove(1); // [2, 4]
System.out.println(set.contains(5)); // false
set.remove(0); // [2, 4]
// if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens

for(int element : set){
  System.out.println(element);
}
// You can iterate through an set in sorted order
```

<PySection>

<Warning>

Ordered sets and maps are **not** built into Python. The Python [OrderedDict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) stores keys in the same order as they were inserted in, **not** in sorted order.

## Maps

<Problems problems={problems.ex} />

A **map** is a set of ordered pairs, each containing a **key** and a **value**. In a map, all keys are required to be unique, but values can be repeated. Maps have three primary methods: 

  - one to add a specified key-value pairing
  - one to retrieve the value for a given key
  - one to remove a key-value pairing from the map

Insertions, deletions, and searches are all $O(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of elements in the map.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

In a C++ [`map`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/) `m`:

 - the `m[key] = value` operator assigns a value to a key and places the key and value pair into the map. The operator `m[key]` returns the value associated with the key. If the key is not present in the map, then `m[key]` is set to 0. 
 - The `count(key)` method returns the number of times the key is in the map (which is either one or zero), and therefore checks whether a key exists in the map. 
 - Lastly, `erase(key)` removes the map entry associated with the specified key. 

```cpp
map<int, int> m;
m[1] = 5; // [(1, 5)]
m[3] = 14; // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
m[2] = 7; // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
m.erase(2); // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
cout << m[1] << '\n'; // 5
cout << m.count(7) << '\n' ; // 0
cout << m.count(1) << '\n' ; // 1
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

In a `TreeMap`, the `put(key, value)` method assigns a value to a key and places the key and value pair into the map. The `get(key)` method returns the value associated with the key. The `containsKey(key)` method checks whether a key exists in the map. Lastly, `remove(key)` removes the map entry associated with the specified key. All of these operations are $O(1)$, but again, due to the hashing, this has a high constant factor.

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>();
map.put(1, 5); // [(1, 5)]
map.put(3, 14); // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
map.put(2, 7); // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
map.remove(2); // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
System.out.println(map.get(1)); // 5
System.out.println(map.containsKey(7)); // false
System.out.println(map.containsKey(1)); // true
```

What about `size()`, iterating over map?
