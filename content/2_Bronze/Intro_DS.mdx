## Data Structures

A **data structure** determines how data is organized so that information can be used efficiently. Each data structure supports some operations efficiently, while other operations are either inefficient or not supported at all. Since different operations are supported by each data structure, you should carefully evaluate which data structure will work best for your particular problem.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

The C++ [standard library data structures](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/) are designed to store any type of data. We put the desired data type within the `<>` brackets when declaring the data structure, as follows:

```cpp
vector<string> v;
```

This creates a `vector` structure that only stores objects of type `string`.

For our examples below, we will primarily use the `int` data type, but note that you can use any data type including `string` and user-defined structures.

Essentially, every standard library data structure supports the `size()` method, which returns the number of elements in the data structure, and the `empty()` method, which returns `true` if the data structure is empty, and `false` otherwise.

## Arrays

You already know one of the simplest data structures: the **array**! In C++11, in addition to _normal arrays_, there exists an [`array` class](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/array/array/) in the STL. For example, an `array` of `int`s can be initialized using the following line of code:

```cpp
array<int, 25> ar;
```

The array class supports the normal STL operations (such as `.empty()` or `.size()`) as well as the normal square-bracket access operator:

```cpp
ar[5] //access the element at the 5th index.
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

Java default [`Collections`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html) data structures are designed to store any type of object. However, we usually don't want our data structures to only store one type of data, like integers or strings. We do this by putting the desired data type within the `<>` brackets when declaring the data structure, as follows:

```java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
```

This creates an `ArrayList` structure that only stores objects of type `String`.

For our examples below, we will primarily use the `Integer` data type, but note that you can have Collections of any object type, including `Strings` , other Collections, or user-defined objects.

`Collections` data types always contain an `add` method for adding an element to the collection, and a `remove` method which removes and returns a certain element from the collection. They also support the `size()` method, which returns the number of elements in the data structure, and the `isEmpty()` method, which returns `true` if the data structure is empty, and `false` otherwise.

## Lists

The default way to store data in Python is using a **list**, which can automatically resize itself to accommodate more elements. We can add and delete elements at the end in $O(1)$ time. A list can be initialized as follows:

```py
list = []
```

Python lists are **generic**. This means that they can store any kind of data type, including objects. For example, the following code creates a dynamic array and adds the numbers $1$ through $10$ to it:

```py
for i in range(1, 11): # Note that range(i, j) includes i, but does not include j
    list.append(i)
```

In Python, we can give a dynamic array an initial size. The code below creates a dynamic array with $30$ zeroes.

```py
list = [0] * 30
```

### Iterating

We can use a regular for loop to iterate through all elements of a list.

```py
list = [1, 7, 4, 5, 2]

for i in range(len(list)):
    print(list[i], end = " ")
print()

for element in list:
    print(element, end = " ")
print()
```

We can also use **iterators**. An iterator allows you to traverse a container by pointing to an object within the container. `iter(list)` returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the list `list`.

```py
list = [4, 2, 0, 0, 5]
it = iter(list)

print(next(it)) # 4
print(next(it)) # 2
print(next(it)) # 0
```

### Inserting and Erasing

```py
list = []
list.append(2) # [2]
list.append(3) # [2, 3]
list.append(7) # [2, 3, 7]
list.append(5) # [2, 3, 7, 5]
list[1] = 4; # sets element at index 1 to 4 -> [2, 4, 7, 5]
list.pop(1) # removes element at index 1 -> [2, 7, 5]
# this remove method is O(n); to be avoided
list.append(8) # [2, 7, 5, 8]
list.pop() # [2, 7, 5]
# here, we remove the element from the end of the list; this is O(1).
list.append(4) # [2, 7, 5, 4]
list.append(4) # [2, 7, 5, 4, 4]
list.append(9) # [2, 7, 5, 4, 4, 9]
print(list[2]) # 5
list = list[3:] # [4, 4, 9]
# this erases the first three elements; O(n)
```

## Dynamic Arrays

<Resources>
	<Resource source="IUSACO" title="4.1, 4.2 - Dynamic Arrays">
		module is based off this
	</Resource>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="4.1 - Dynamic Arrays">
		vectors, strings
	</Resource>
	<Resource source="PAPS" title="3.1 - Vectors"></Resource>
</Resources>

Dynamic arrays ([`vector`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) in C++) support all the functions that a normal array does, and can resize itself to accommodate more elements. In a dynamic array, we can also add and delete elements at the end in $O(1)$ time.

For example, the following code creates a dynamic array and adds the numbers $1$ through $10$ to it:

```cpp
vector<int> v;
for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    v.push_back(i);
}
```

In C++, we can give a dynamic array an initial size. The code below creates a dynamic array with $30$ zeroes.

```cpp
vector<int> v(30); // one way
vector<int> v; v.resize(30); // another way
```

In array-based contest problems, we'll use one-, two-, and three-dimensional static arrays most of the time. However, we can also have static arrays of dynamic arrays, dynamic arrays of static arrays, and so on. Usually, the choice between a static array and a dynamic array is just personal preference.

<Warning>

Nothing beyond this warning is required knowledge for Bronze, though you may find it useful.

</Warning>

### Iterating

Note: Iterating isn't required for Bronze, though it may be useful.

<Resources>
	<Resource source="CPH" title="4.4 - Working With Ranges">
		{' '}
	</Resource>
	<Resource
		source="CPP"
		title="Reference - <iterator>"
		url="https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/"
	>
		{' '}
	</Resource>
</Resources>

One way to iterate through all elements of a static or dynamic array is to use a regular for loop.

```cpp
vector<int> v{1,7,4,5,2};
for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++){
    cout << v[i] << " ";
}
cout << endl;
```

We can also use **iterators**. An iterator allows you to traverse a container by pointing to an object within the container. However, they are **not** the same thing as pointers.

For example, `v.begin()` or `begin(v)` returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the vector `v`. Apart from the standard way of traversing a vector (by treating it as an array), you can also use iterators:

```cpp
for (vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
    cout << *it << " "; //prints the values in the vector using the iterator
}
```

Here is another way to write this. `auto` (since C++11) automatically infers the type of an object:

```cpp
vector<int> v{1,7,4,5,2};
for (auto it = begin(v); it != end(v); it = next(it)) {
	cout << *it << " "; //prints the values in the vector using the iterator
}
```

We can also use a for-each loop.

```cpp
for (int element : v) {
    cout << element << " "; //prints the values in the vector
}
```

### Inserting and Erasing

Note: Inserting and Erasing isn't required for Bronze, though it may be useful.

Keep in mind that insertion and erasure in the middle of a `vector` are $O(n)$.

```cpp
vector<int> v;
v.push_back(2); // [2]
v.push_back(3); // [2, 3]
v.push_back(7); // [2, 3, 7]
v.push_back(5); // [2, 3, 7, 5]
v[1] = 4; // sets element at index 1 to 4 -> [2, 4, 7, 5]
v.erase(v.begin() + 1); // removes element at index 1 -> [2, 7, 5]
// this remove method is O(n); to be avoided
v.push_back(8); // [2, 7, 5, 8]
v.erase(v.end()-1); // [2, 7, 5]
// here, we remove the element from the end of the list; this is O(1).
v.push_back(4); // [2, 7, 5, 4]
v.push_back(4); // [2, 7, 5, 4, 4]
v.push_back(9); // [2, 7, 5, 4, 4, 9]
cout << v[2]; // 5
v.erase(v.begin(), v.begin()+3); // [4, 4, 9]
// this erases the first three elements; O(n)
```

### Strings

<IncompleteSection>

All the vector operations above also work on strings.

<JavaSection>

## Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays ([`ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) in Java) that support all the functions that a normal array does, and can repeatedly reallocate storage to accommodate more elements as they are added.

In a dynamic array, we can also add and delete elements at the end in $O(1)$ time. For example, the following code creates a dynamic array and adds the numbers $1$ through $10$ to it:

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    list.add(i);
}
```

In array-based contest problems, we'll use one-, two-, and three-dimensional static arrays most of the time. However, we can also have static arrays of dynamic arrays, dynamic arrays of static arrays, and so on. Usually, the choice between a static array and a dynamic array is just personal preference.

### Iterating

Note: Iterating isn't required for Bronze, though it may be useful.

To iterate through a static or dynamic array, we can use either the regular for loop or the for-each loop.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
list.add(1); list.add(7); list.add(4); list.add(5); list.add(2);
int[] arr = {1, 7, 4, 5, 2};
for(int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++){ // regular
    System.out.println(list.get(i));
}
for(int element : arr){ // for-each
    System.out.println(element);
}
```

### Adding and Removing

Note: Adding and Removing isn't required for Bronze, though it may be useful.

We can add and remove at any index of a dynamic array in $O(n)$ time.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
list.add(2); // [2]
list.add(3); // [2, 3]
list.add(7); // [2, 3, 7]
list.add(5); // [2, 3, 7, 5]
list.set(1, 4); // sets element at index 1 to 4 -> [2, 4, 7, 5]
list.remove(1); // removes element at index 1 -> [2, 7, 5]
// this remove method is O(n); to be avoided
list.add(8); // [2, 7, 5, 8]
list.remove(list.size()-1); // [2, 7, 5]
// here, we remove the element from the end of the list; this is $O(1)$.
System.out.println(list.get(2)); // 5
```

## Pairs & Tuples

Note: Pairs & Tuples aren't required for Bronze, though it may be useful.

If we want to store a collection of points on the 2D plane, then we can use a dynamic array of **pairs**.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

Of course, both `vector<vector<int>>` and `vector<array<int,2>>` would suffice for this case, but a pair can also store two elements of different types.

### [C++ Pairs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/pair/)

- `pair<type1, type2> p`: Creates a pair `p` with two elements with the first one being of `type1` and the second one being of `type2`.
- `make_pair(a, b)`: Returns a pair with values `a`, `b`.
- `{a, b}`: With C++11 and above, this can be used as to create a pair, which is easier to write than `make_pair(a, b)`.
- `pair.first`: The first value of the pair.
- `pair.second`: The second value of the pair.

Example:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	pair<string, int> myPair1 = make_pair("Testing", 123);
	cout << myPair1.first << " " << myPair1.second << endl;
	myPair1.first = "It is possible to edit pairs after declaring them";
	cout << myPair1.first << " " << myPair1.second << endl;
	pair<string, string> myPair2 = {"Testing", "curly braces"};
	cout << myPair2.first << " " << myPair2.second << endl;
}

/* Output:
Testing 123
It is possible to edit pairs after declaring them 123
Testing curly braces
*/
```

### [C++ Tuples](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/tuple/)

Of course, we can hold more than two values with something like `pair<int,pair<int,int>>`, but it gets messy when you need a lot of elements. In this case, using **tuples** might be more convenient.

- `tuple<type1, type2, ..., typeN> t`: Creates a tuple with `N` elements, i'th one being of `typei`.
- `make_tuple(a, b, c, ..., d)`: Returns a tuple with values written in the brackets.
- `get<i>(t)`: Returns the `i`'th element of the tuple `t`. Can also be used to change the element of a tuple.

This operation only works for constant `i`. Namely, it is **not** allowed to do something like the following since `i` is not constant:

```cpp
tuple<int,int,int> t{3,4,5};
int i = 1; cout << get<i>(t);
```

- `tie(a, b, c, ..., d) = t`: Equals `a, b, c, ..., d` to the elements of the tuple $t$ accordingly.

<!-- This is not frequently used by competitive programmers, but it is good to know and can help simplify things sometimes.  -->

Example:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int a = 3, b = 4, c = 5;
	tuple<int, int, int> t = tie(a, b, c);
	cout << get<0>(t) << " " << get<1>(t) << " " << get<2>(t) << endl;
	get<0>(t) = 7;
	cout << get<0>(t) << " " << get<1>(t) << " " << get<2>(t) << endl;

	tuple<string, string, int> tp2 = make_tuple("Hello", "world", 100);
	string s1, s2; int x;
	tie(s1, s2, x) = tp2;
	cout << s1 << " " << s2 << " " << x << endl;
}

/* Output:
3 4 5
7 4 5
Hello world 100
*/
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

### Java

<Warning title="Language Note">

Pairs and tuples are not available in Java's standard libraries, though we can work around that.

</Warning>

We can create our own generic Pair class in Java:

```java
static class Pair<K, V> {
	K first;
	V second;

	public Pair(K first_value, V second_value) {
		first = first_value;
		second = second_value;
	}
}
```

Then, we can use the `Pair` class as follows:

```java
Pair<Integer, String> p = new Pair(5, "hello");
System.out.println(p.first + " " + p.second);
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

<Warning title="Language Note">

**Pairs are not available in Python.** Just use tuples; no need for pairs!

</Warning>

### Python Tuples

Use the link below (if you know of a better one, please let us know!) to learn about tuples.

<!-- Python automatically sorts a list of tuples by the first element, then the second, and so on. This can save you time and keystrokes for certain problems like the one above.

## Memory Allocation

One thing to keep in mind when using arrays is the memory limit. Usually the USACO memory limit is 256 MB, which can store up to roughly 60 million 32-bit`int` values, or less if you're using 64-bit integers, long strings, custom objects, etc. As a general rule of thumb, if your array size exceeds $5 \cdot 10^6$ (5 million), you're at risk of running the memory limit and should consider alternative approaches to the problem.

<CppSection>
	In C++, arrays initialized locally using the default syntax (i.e. `int
	arr[10];` ) are initialized to random numbers, because C++ doesn't have
	built-in memory management. In order to initialize your arrays to zero, either
	declare them globally, or use either `memset(arr, 0, sizeof(arr))` or
	`std::fill(arr, arr+N, 0)` where $N$ is the array length.
</CppSection>

## Problems

Nothing to see here! Arrays of fixed size suffice for almost every Bronze problem, but dynamic arrays, pairs, and tuples can greatly simplify implementation at times.

<!-- Unless someone has any. I really can't find anything... -->
