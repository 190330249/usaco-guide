Due to recursion not being required by any problems in USACO Bronze, this module has been moved to [Silver](/silver/complete-rec-silver).

However, it's not a bad idea for a bronze contestant to read the above module, as some problems in the bronze division (such as those listed below) are easier with recursion.
