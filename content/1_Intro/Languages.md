## Choosing a Language

The most popular languages that USACO supports are [C++11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), and [Python 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). In general, we recommend the following:

 - If you already know one of these languages, just use it. 
   - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java, and Java over Python.
 - For Bronze, any language will do.
 - For Silver, Gold, and Platinum, Python is not recommended.

Keep in mind that it's easy to switch languages down the road. Don't get caught up on which language to choose. Just pick the one you feel most comfortable with!

### Language References

All of these are provided at the IOI aside from the additional C++ reference.

 - [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
   - [Additional C++ Reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/)
 - [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/overview-summary.html)
 - [Python3](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/)

## Expected Knowledge

The remainder of this guide assumes that you know the basics of how to code in one of the languages listed above, including the following topics:

- Variables
  - Data types
- Reading Input
- Writing Output
- Loops
- If / Else
- Logical operators
- Functions
  - Basic Recursion (a function calling itself)
- Arrays
  - Multidimensional Arrays

In particular, contestants using Java should be familiar with roughly the first half of AP Computer Science A. 

 - If you do not meet these prerequisites, see the links below to get started.
 - Familiarity with [competition math](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Resources/Competition%20Math.md) (ex. AIME qualification) is helpful but not required.

## Resources for Learning How to Code


### C++

Use one of these resources (or find your own) to learn C++.

<resources>
  <resource source="Sololearn" title="C++" url="https://www.sololearn.com/Play/CPlusPlus" starred>also courses for Java, Python</resource>
  <resource source="PAPS" title="2 - Programming in C++" starred></resource>
</resources>

If you use Sololearn, we recommend you finish everything up to (but not including) "More on Classes." You don't have to complete the full course.

<info-block title="Pro Tip">

You do not need to learn pointers (for now). Knowledge of structs and classes is useful but not required.
