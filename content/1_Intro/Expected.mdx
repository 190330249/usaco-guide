import { Problem } from "../models";

export const metadata = {
  problems: {
    general: [
      new Problem("Bronze", "Promotion Counting", "591", "Very Easy"),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Word Processor", "987", "Very Easy"),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Square Pasture", "663", "Very Easy"),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Bucket Brigade", "939", "Very Easy"),
    ]
  }
};

The remainder of this guide assumes that you know the basics of how to code in one of the languages listed above, including the following topics:

- Variables
  - Data types
- Reading Input
- Writing Output
- Loops
- If / Else
- Logical operators
- Functions
  - Basic Recursion (a function calling itself)
- Arrays
  - Multidimensional Arrays

In particular, contestants using Java should be familiar with roughly the first half of AP Computer Science A. Familiarity with [competition math](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Resources/Competition%20Math.md) (ex. AIME qualification) is helpful but not required.

## Introductory Problems

The following require relatively little programming experience and no algorithmic knowledge. You should know how to do each of these before moving onto the remainder of Bronze.

Also check the [CSES Introductory Problems](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) up to and including "Palindrome Reorder."

## Getting Started

You may find the following resources helpful for familiarizing yourself with your language of choice.
