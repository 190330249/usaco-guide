import { Problem } from "../models";

export const problems = {
    general: [
      new Problem("Bronze", "Promotion Counting", "591", "Very Easy"),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Teleportation", "807", "Very Easy"),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Square Pasture", "663", "Very Easy"),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Word Processor", "987", "Very Easy"),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Bucket Brigade", "939", "Very Easy"),
    ]
};

The remainder of this guide assumes that you know the basics of how to code in one of the languages listed above, including the following topics:

- Variables
  - Data types
- Reading Input
- Writing Output
- Loops
- If / Else
- Logical operators
- Functions
  - Basic Recursion (a function calling itself)
- Arrays
  - Multidimensional Arrays

In particular, contestants using Java should be familiar with roughly the first half of AP Computer Science A. Familiarity with [competition math](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Resources/Competition%20Math.md) (ex. AIME qualification) is helpful but not required.

## Getting Started

You may find the following resources helpful for familiarizing yourself with your language of choice. Resources below (including starred ones) are optional.

<Resources>
  <Resource source="CodeSignal" title="Arcade, Interview Practice" url="https://codesignal.com/" starred>can practice basics</Resource>
  <Resource source="Philippines OI" title="Prepare" url="https://noi.ph/prepare/" starred>lots of links!</Resource>
  <Resource source="VPlanet" title="Learn to Code" url="https://www.vplanetcoding.com/course1">basic problems, mostly loops</Resource>
  <Resource source="IOI" title="Getting Started" url="https://ioinformatics.org/page/getting-started/14">not up to date</Resource>
  <Resource source="Quora" title="Joshua Pan - Schedule for Beginners" url="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-schedule-to-follow-for-becoming-better-at-competitive-programming-for-beginners">generally good, although CSES problemset (see "Resources") is definitely a better place to start than USACO Training or Codechef</Resource>
</Resources>

## Introductory Problems

The following require relatively little programming experience and no algorithmic knowledge. 

<Problems problems={problems.general} />

Also check the [CSES Introductory Problems](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) up to and including "Palindrome Reorder." Once you're done with these, you should continue onto the rest of Bronze. 

<Warning>

Some modules in the "Intro" section (ex. Fast Input & Output) are not relevant for USACO Bronze contestants. It is probably best to skip these for now  and return to these later. <!-- However, make sure to check [Code Conventions](./code-con) for the templates that will be used for code snippets in later modules!
 -->
</Warning>
