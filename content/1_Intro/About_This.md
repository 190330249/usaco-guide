## Goals

 - Intended audience: anybody in Bronze - Gold.
   - We are **not** teaching people how to code (but we'll provide some links for this purpose).
   - should be a "one stop shop," meaning that this is the only site they have to use. 
     - The idea is that people will no longer have to go resource hunting as we’ll do all of that for them. 
   - For Bronze - Gold, most but not all problems on monthly contests will fall into the categories that we have designated. For Platinum, there are no guarantees.
   - Note that topics may cross divisions without warning! (ex. Gold seems to have more and more tree problems that used to be confined to Platinum).
 - Material will be grouped into **modules**.
   - USACO-Focused: generally avoid covering topics that will not appear on USACO or IOI.
   - Maybe designate some "optional" modules.
 - "Don’t Reinvent the Wheel"
   - Should set guidelines as to what counts and what doesn’t.
   - Link to online resources that already exist.
 - Not *just* a collection of links
   - There exist plenty of resources out there. While we can link to all of them, we should not expect users to click through all of them to find the information they want. This means in addition to links we need to provide information about what the link talks about, as well as the quality of the link.
   - We don’t want to say something like “learn DP, here are 50 links that can teach you that.” Instead, we want to say “learn DP by first reading this one article, then reading this other article. For reference, here are some other links you can explore as you wish.”

## Module Organization

### Lesson

 - Consists of text, videos, and simple problems.
 - Goal is to introduce user to the concept.
 - Everything should be completed in order.
 - Any problems here should be pure implementation.
 - Languages
   - Include C++, Java, Python for Bronze.
   - Include C++, Java for Silver and beyond (C++ takes priority)

### Practice

 - Link the relevant past USACO problems (and other recommended problems). 
 - Problems should be sorted in order of how they are recommended be completed. 
   - Add comments regarding difficulty and / or solution sketches.
 - Possibly include additional problems.
