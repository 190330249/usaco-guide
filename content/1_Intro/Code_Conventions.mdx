The code we provide should follow the conventions below. Please note that you do _not_ have to copy our conventions; there is no "right" convention for coding!

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

If you find unrecognizable symbols or functions in `C++` code, note the template below; everything should compile assuming that the template below is included.

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection />

<PySection />

</LanguageSection>

If any code does not compile or is hard to read, submit a complaint using the "Contact Us" button.

## General

Note that these conventions mostly apply to `C++` and `Java`.

 - Indenting with either tabs or 4 spaces is fine.
 - Binary operators should be spaced on both sides. For example, `a+b` should be written as `a + b` and `x=a+b` should be written as `x = a + b`.
 - Unary operators should only be spaced on the left side, ex. `x = -y`.
 - Semicolons and commas should be spaced on the right side, ex. `f(a, b, c)`.
 - Braces that open on one line should close on another. Always include braces, even if the code inside them is only one line.
 - Parentheses should be spaced from the outside. For example, we would write `if (a == b) {` or `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {`.
 - Use `++x` rather than `x++` to increment a variable (ie. in a `for` loop).
 - Start your `else` statement on the same line as the closing brace of your `if` statement, like so:

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
if (a == b) {
	++a;
} else {
	++b;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
if (a == b) {
	++a;
} else {
	++b;
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

```py
if (a == b):
	a += 1
else
	b += 1
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>
 

 - Use `true / false` for boolean values, not `1 / 0`. 
 - Write comments to explain any uncommon library functions like the C++ functions `__builtin_ffs()` or `tie(a, b, c)`.
 - Write comments to explain anything weird in general! :)

## Template

The "template" refers to code that is assumed to be in every file.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

Templates in C++ can take advantange of more powerful features than the other contest languages, and they can be more customized to each competitor. Don't be afraid to write your own template or don't use one at all! Regardless, The USACO Guide will assume the use of the below template in any C++ Code.

See [C++ Tips & Tricks](./cpp-tips) for explanations of the following code.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

using vi = vector<int>;
#define pb push_back
#define rsz resize
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define f first
#define s second
#define mp make_pair

void setIO(string name = "") { // name is nonempty for USACO file I/O
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); // see Fast Input & Output
	freopen((name+".in").c_str(), "r", stdin); // see Input & Output
	freopen((name+".out").c_str(), "w", stdout);
}

// the code that we provide requires everything above this line to compile

int main() {
	setIO();

}
```

<!-- Any preferences? Also, this doesn't apply to the custom sorting module, make sure to include all 3! :) -->

Additional C++ Conventions:

 - Avoid the use of macros (`#define`) other than those in the template above.
 - Use `const` in C++ for variables that don't change through the code.
 - Use `make_pair` rather than `{}` to store a pair. 
 - Use `auto` to increase readability (ex. when dealing with iterators). 
 - Use `struct` instead of `class`. <!-- Even if you are copy pasting a `struct`, space it out rather than squeezing it into one line. -->
 - Use UpperCamelCase for custom structs (`SegTree, Point`) and lowerCamelCase for functions (`solve(), binarySearch()`). Constants should be fully capitalized (`INF, MOD, SOME_CONST`). 

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

A normal Java template will contain a main method, helpful imports, and some form of I/O (for USACO, this would probably be File I/O)

```java
import java.io.*; //Imports necessary classes to read and write files
import java.util.*; //Imports many useful data structures and algorithms libraries

public class Main { //Name your program whatever you like. Note the class name must match the file name (e.g. this file would be "Main.java")

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { //The code below reads from stdin and also uses a slow input method. Read "Intro - Fast I/O" for other Java I/O techniques.
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);
	}
}

```
