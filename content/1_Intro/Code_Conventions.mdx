The code we provide should follow the conventions below. Please note that you do _not_ have to copy our conventions; there is no "right" convention for coding!

## General

 - Indenting with either tabs or 4 spaces is fine.
 - Binary operators should be spaced on both sides. For example, `a+b` should be written as `a + b` and `x=a+b` should be written as `x = a + b`.
 - Unary operators should only be spaced on the left side, ex. `x = -y`.
 - Semicolons and commas should be spaced on the right side, ex. `f(a, b, c)`.
 - Braces that open on one line should close on another. Always include braces, even if the code inside them is only one line.
 - Parentheses should be spaced from the outside. For example, we would write `if (a == b) {` or `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {`.
 - Use `++x` rather than `x++` to increment a variable (ie. in a `for` loop).
 - Start your `else` statement on the same line as the closing brace of your `if` statement, like so:

  ```cpp
  if (a == b) {
    ++a;
  } else {
    ++b;
  }
  ```

 - Use `true / false` for boolean values, not `1 / 0`. 
 - Explain the use of any not well known standard library functions with comments that haven't been introduced before like `__builtin_ffs()` or `tie(a, b, c)` in C++.

## C++ Template

`#include <bits/stdc++.h>` will be used in place of separately including libraries.

  <resource source="GFG" title="GFG - <bits/stdc++.h>" url="bitsstdc-h-c"> </resource>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

using vi = vector<int>;
#define pb push_back
#define rsz resize
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define f first
#define s second
#define mp make_pair

void setIO(string name = "") { // name is nonempty for USACO file I/O
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); // see Fast Input & Output
	freopen((name+".in").c_str(), "r", stdin); // see Input & Output
	freopen((name+".out").c_str(), "w", stdout);
}

int main() {
    setIO();

<!-- Avoid using tabs? Does this cause any problems on usaco-guide? -->

<!-- Any preferences? Also, this doesn't apply to the custom sorting module, make sure to include all 3! :) -->

 - Avoid the use of macros (`#define`) other than those in the template above. *See "Shortening C++" for more information about macros.*
 - Use `const` in C++ for variables that don't change through the code.
 - Use `make_pair` rather than `{}` to store a pair. 
 - Use `auto` to increase readability (ex. when dealing with iterators). 
 - Use `struct` instead of `class`. <!-- Even if you are copy pasting a `struct`, space it out rather than squeezing it into one line. -->
 - Use UpperCamelCase for custom structs (`SegTree, Point`) and lowerCamelCase for functions (`solve(), binarySearch()`). Constants should be fully capitalized (`INF, MOD, SOME_CONST`).
