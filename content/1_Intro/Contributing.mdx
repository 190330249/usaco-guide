- Adding descriptions for sections, modules, resources, etc.
- Adding or expanding a specific module.
- Adding or fixing implementations, including code for input & output.
- Improving problemsets (add / remove problems depending on whether they are good examples of the module topic or not).
- Fixing problem difficulties (most are inaccurate), tags.
- Adding official editorial links for problems (those for USACO are automatically generated).
- Adding an editorial (if no editorial exists, or if existing editorial could be improved).
