Here's what you should learn before reading these resources.

<!-- END DESCRIPTION -->
 
These resources do **not** teach you how to code. We recommend you learn roughly the first half of AP Computer Science A before continuing. If you do not meet these prerequisites, you can go to the resources below to get started.

Familiarity with [competition math](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Resources/Competition%20Math.md) (ex. AIME qualification) is helpful but not required.

## Expected Knowledge

- Variables
  - Data types
- Reading Input
- Writing Output
- Loops
- If/else
- Logical operators
- Functions
  - Basic Recursion (a function calling itself)
- Arrays
  - Multidimensional Arrays

## Resources for Learning How to Code

[Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) has courses on C++, Java, and Python. You don't have to complete the full course.

 - For C++, we recommend you finish Sololearn up to (but not including) "More on Classes."

[[info | Pro Tip]]
| You do not need to learn pointers (for now). Knowledge of structs and classes is useful but not required.
