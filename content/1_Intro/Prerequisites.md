## Expected Knowledge

This guide assumes that you know the basics of how to code, including the following topics:

- Variables
  - Data types
- Reading Input
- Writing Output
- Loops
- If / Else
- Logical operators
- Functions
  - Basic Recursion (a function calling itself)
- Arrays
  - Multidimensional Arrays

In particular, contestants using Java should be familiar with roughly the first half of AP Computer Science A. If you do not meet these prerequisites, see the links below to get started.

Familiarity with [competition math](https://github.com/bqi343/USACO/blob/master/Resources/Competition%20Math.md) (ex. AIME qualification) is helpful but not required.

## Resources for Learning How to Code

[Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) has courses on C++, Java, and Python. You don't have to complete the full course.

 - For C++, we recommend you finish Sololearn up to (but not including) "More on Classes."

[[info | Pro Tip]]
| You do not need to learn pointers (for now). Knowledge of structs and classes is useful but not required.
