Each of the \~26 finalists is either a **Holstein** or a **Guernsey**. 

 - Guernseys
   - no seniors or past finalists
   - mostly lectures by Brian
   - two contests
 - Holsteins (1/3 to 1/2 of all finalists)
   - can include first-time finalists
   - six contests ~~(fun!!)~~

Contests 3-5 hrs with 3-4 problems each ~~and are frequently extended for lunch breaks~~

## Selection

(Mostly) based on:

  - results of monthly platinum contests
    - US Open is given more weight
    - may take into account if you weren't able to participate in one (or more?) platinum contests assuming that you were participating in a lower division at that time
  - grade level (lower is better)
  - past camp qualification
  - sample cases
    - if you submit all of them ~~then your total score might increase by half a problem across the whole season!~~
  - "improvement"
    - increasing >> decreasing score sequence!

For Guernsey, averaging one problem per contest won't suffice but one problem plus some partial credit (probably?) will.
