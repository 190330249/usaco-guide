Each of the \~26 finalists is either a **Holstein** or a **Guernsey**. 

 - Guernseys
   - no seniors or past finalists
   - two contests
 - Holsteins (1/3 to 1/2 of all finalists)
   - can include first-time finalists
   - six contests ~~(fun!!)~~

Contests are 3-5 hrs with 3-4 problems each ~~and are frequently extended for lunch breaks.~~

Campers generally average at least one problem and some partial credit per contest (where "some" varies a lot).

Submitting all the sample cases ~~might increase your total score by half a problem across the whole season!!~~
