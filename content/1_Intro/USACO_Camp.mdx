One third to one half of the \~26 finalists are **Holsteins**, while the remainder are **Guernseys**. Holsteins get six 3-5 hr contests with 3-4 problems each while Guernseys get lectures by Brian. ~~(fun!!)~~

Selection is (mostly) based on:

  - scores monthly platinum contests (with US Open weighted more)
    - may take into account if you weren't able to participate in one (or more?) platinum contests if you were still participating lower division contests at that time
  - grade level (lower is better)
    - seniors can't be Guernseys
  - past camp qualification
    - past finalists can't be Guernseys
  - "improvement"
    - increasing >> decreasing score sequence!
  - sample cases
    - if you submit all of them ~~that might increase your total score by half a problem~~

For Guernsey, averaging one problem per contest won't suffice but one problem plus some partial credit (probably?) will.
