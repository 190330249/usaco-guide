## Module Organization

All material will be grouped into **modules** such as the one you're reading right now.

### Guidelines

 - Should be a "one stop shop," meaning that this is the only site you have to use to be exposed to most (if not all) of the topics required for Bronze - Gold. 
   - The idea is that people will no longer have to go resource hunting as we’ll do all of that for them. 
 - "Don’t Reinvent the Wheel"
   - We'll link to online resources that already exist whenever possible.
 - Not *just* a collection of links
   - There exist plenty of resources out there, but we do not expect users to click through all of them to find the information they want. 
   - This means in addition to the link itself we need to provide information about what the link is about as well as the quality of the link.
   - We don’t want to say something like "learn DP, here are 50 links that can teach you that." Instead, we want to say "learn DP by first reading this one article, then reading this other article. For reference, here are some other links you can explore as you wish."

### Lesson

 - Consists of text, videos, and simple problems.
 - Goal is to introduce user to the concept.
 - Everything should be completed in order.
 - Any problems here should be pure implementation.
 - Languages
   - Include C++ and Java for all divisions. (C++ takes priority)
   - Possibly Python for Bronze.

### Practice

 - Link the relevant past USACO problems (and other recommended problems). 
 - Problems should be sorted in order of how they are recommended be completed. 
   - Add comments regarding difficulty and / or solution sketches.
 - Possibly include additional problems.

## Choosing a Language

The most popular languages that USACO supports are C++11, Java, and Python 3. In general, we recommend the following:

 - If you already know one of these languages, just use it. 
   - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java, and Java over Python.
 - For Bronze, any language will do.
 - For Silver, Gold, and Platinum, Python is not recommended.

Keep in mind that it's easy to switch languages down the road. Don't get caught up on which language to choose. Just pick the one you feel most comfortable with!
