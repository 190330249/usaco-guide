description: How this guide is organized.
---

All material in this guide will be grouped into **modules** such as the one you're reading right now.

## Lesson

  - Goal is to introduce you to the concept.
  - Everything is meant to be completed in order.
  - Usually begins with at least one standard problem.
  - External resources (text, possibly videos) will generally be placed in tables like the one above. We'll **star** those that we expect you to read.

<spoiler title="Hidden Content">

If we expect you to spend time thinking about a sample problem before checking the solution we'll place the solution in **spoiler blocks** like this.

It's okay to skip over these. Some material in these boxes might not be useful for competitive programming.

## Implementations

Code should compile by itself, example input / output should be provided. Macros should generally be avoided.

  - For Bronze, we will provide code snippets in C++, Java, and Python.
  - For Silver and Gold, we will provide code snippets in C++ and Java and (sometimes) Python.
  - For Platinum, code snippets might only be provided in C++.

Will contain common errors that you should avoid.

## Practice

<info-block title="Pro Tip">

Maybe helpful bits of advice.

</info-block>

  - Link relevant past USACO problems (and other recommended problems).
  - Problems should be sorted in order of how they are recommended be completed.
    - Add comments regarding solution sketches.
  - At some point we'll write full editorials for those problems which don't have them (or if existing editorials are poorly written).
  - Difficulty ranges from "Very Easy" to "Insane." Difficulty is **not** comparable across modules (even of the same division).
    - "Intro" refers to a problem that just asks you to implement a standard algorithm or data structure.


<!-- Difficulty should be comparable across a division. Say that you have *almost-solved* a question if you scored at least $n-2$ out of $n$ test cases. At least for platinum, difficulty levels should correspond approximately to the following USA Pre-college almost-solve rates on a USACO contest:

  - Easy: $\ge 40\%$ (ex. Fort Moo, Team Building, Redistricting)
  - Normal: $\ge 20\%$ (ex. Card Game, Balancing, Gathering)
  - Hard: $\ge 10\%$ (ex. Mooriokart, Train Tracking 2, Friendcross)

Old gold problems should probably be bumped up one level. -->
