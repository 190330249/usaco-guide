title: Modules
author: Nathan Wang, Benjamin Qi
description: How this guide is organized.
---

The material in this guide will be grouped into **modules** such as the one you're reading right now. A module will consist of several resources, practice problems, and additional content specific to the module. 

## Lesson <!--- what's this? is a lesson equivalent to a module? --->
  - The goal is to introduce you to the concept.
  - Everything is meant to be completed in order.
  - Usually begins with at least one standard problem, marked "Intro" in the difficulty column.
  <!--- Go through and mark standard problems (relative to topic) Intro? --->
  - External resources will be placed in tables like the one above. We'll **star** those that we highly recommend you read.

<spoiler title="Hidden Content">

In some modules, codes or solutions will be placed in **spoiler blocks** like this. In these cases, you should think about the problem or try to implement it yourself before revealing the solution or code.

<optional-content title="Optional Content">

Not all content in this guide is essential to competitive programming. Skipping over optional content is fine, but if you're interested, feel free to explore further as well.

## Implementations

All implementations should compile, have example input / output provided, and have relatively few macros. If any code does not compile or is hard to read, submit a complaint using the "Contact Us" tab.

  - For Bronze, we will provide code snippets in C++, Java, and Python.
  - For Silver and Gold, we will provide code snippets in C++ and Java and sometimes Python.
  - For Platinum, code snippets might only be provided in C++.

<warning-block>

A warning block like this will contain common errors that you should avoid.

<!-- Code Style Guide? Though I think forcing a style onto people is kind of bad, maybe just avoid things that are generally bad... -->

## Practice

<info-block title="Pro Tip">

Helpful bits of advice provided by the author.

  - Link relevant past USACO problems (and other recommended problems).
  - Problems should be sorted in order of how they are recommended be completed.
    - Add comments regarding solution sketches.
  - At some point we'll write full editorials for those problems which don't have them (or if existing editorials are poorly written).
  - Difficulty ranges from "Very Easy" to "Insane." Difficulty is **not** comparable across modules (even of the same division), but rather relative to the topic <!-- (in other words, if a problem can easily be solved using some topic, then it will be marked "Easy" or "Intro" even if very few people solved it in contest because they didn't know the topic). (Uncomment if nobody has problems with this interpretation) -->
    - "Intro" refers to a problem that just asks you to implement a standard algorithm or data structure.
    - "Easy" refers to a problem that can be solved relatively quickly be someone who is familiar with the module, while also approachable by someone who has just finished reading the starred resources.
    - "Medium" refers to a problem which requires a bit more thinking, but can also be solved by people who have done sufficent <!-- relative to person --> practice of easy problems.
    - "Hard" refers to a problem which may take a lot of time to approach. However, if someone has done a large number of "Medium" problems and has a strong understanding of a topic, could theoretically be solved during a USACO contest. <!-- 4 / 5 hour period? depends on problem really. and person (if you're Benq you'll solve it in the contest period) -->
    - "Very Hard" refers to a problem that will challenge even very strong contestants and often requires multiple levels of observations and more knowledge than provided by the module. <!-- (Uncomment?) You will probably end up reading editorials for most of these problems, but try to solve at least one by yourself. -->
    - "Insane" refers to problems that are often horribly misplaced in their division. These problems are often a bad representation of the difficulty of problems in a USACO division. However, this does not mean that these problems cannot be interesting. If you want a challenge, try them out.

<!-- Difficulty should be comparable across a division. Say that you have *almost-solved* a question if you scored at least $n-2$ out of $n$ test cases. At least for platinum, difficulty levels should correspond approximately to the following USA Pre-college almost-solve rates on a USACO contest:

  - Easy: $\ge 40\%$ (ex. Fort Moo, Team Building, Redistricting)
  - Normal: $\ge 20\%$ (ex. Card Game, Balancing, Gathering)
  - Hard: $\ge 10\%$ (ex. Mooriokart, Train Tracking 2, Friendcross)

Old gold problems should probably be bumped up one level. -->

<!-- Re: above. Almost-solved is subjective to problem though. Incorrect greedy "almost solves" deleg."" -->
