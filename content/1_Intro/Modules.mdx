title: Modules
author: Nathan Wang, Benjamin Qi
description: How each module is structured.
---

The material in this guide will be grouped into **modules** such as the one you're reading right now. A module generally consists of three parts:

1. **Module Lesson**: Introduces the concept
2. **Practice Problems**: Teaches you how to apply the concept to various problems
3. **Additional Content**: Optional resources related to the module, for those who are interested

## 1. Module Lesson

The module lesson is a curated collection of external resources, problems, and supplementary text we've written ourselves.

- The goal is to introduce you to the concept.
- Everything is meant to be completed in order.
- It usually begins with at least one standard problem, marked "Intro" in the difficulty column.
    - The standard problem is a direct application of the concept, and is useful in testing your implementation.
- We'll **star** external resources that we highly recommend you read. Feel free to read the others if you don't understand something.

### 2. Implementations

The module lesson usually contains an implementation of the solution to the standard problem. All implementations should compile, have example input / output provided, and have relatively few macros. If any code does not compile or is hard to read, submit a complaint using the "Contact Us" button.

- For Bronze, we will provide code snippets in C++, Java, and Python.
- For Silver and Gold, we will provide code snippets in C++ and Java and sometimes Python.
- For Platinum, code snippets might only be provided in C++.

Implementations we provide will follow certain [conventions listed at the bottom of this module](#code-conventions). You do not have to copy our conventions!

## Practice Problems

After reading the module lesson, you'll be given a lot of problems (from various sources, not just USACO) to practice applying the concept you've learned.

- The problems are roughly sorted in order of how they are recommended to be completed.
- You don't have to solve every problem, just enough to feel comfortable with the module. We've starred the ones we found most interesting.

### Problem Editorials

We'll try our best to write full editorials for problems which don't have them (or if existing editorials are poorly written). _Starred problems will generally have better editorials._

_Pre-release note_: Currently, very few problems have full editorials. We've provided some temporary _solution sketches_ (very short solution explanations) while we continue working on this guide. If you believe an editorial is needed for a problem, please let us know using the "Contact Us" button.

### Problem Difficulty

Difficulty ranges from "Very Easy" to "Insane." Difficulty is **not** comparable across modules (even of the same division). Difficulty represents how challenging a problem is expected to be to someone after they read through the module, not how difficult the problem is in general.

- "**Intro**" refers to a problem that just asks you to implement a standard algorithm or data structure.
- "**Easy**" refers to a problem that can be solved relatively quickly be someone who is familiar with the module, while also approachable by someone who has just finished reading the starred resources.
- "**Normal**" refers to a problem which requires a bit more thinking, but can also be solved by people who have done sufficent practice of easy problems.
- "**Hard**" refers to a problem which may take a lot of time to approach. However, if someone has done a large number of "Medium" problems and has a strong understanding of a topic, could theoretically be solved during a USACO contest.
- "**Very Hard**" refers to a problem that will challenge even very strong contestants and often requires multiple levels of observations and more knowledge than provided by the module.
- "**Insane**" refers to problems that are misplaced in their division. These problems are often a bad representation of the difficulty of problems in a USACO division. However, this does not mean that these problems cannot be interesting. If you want a challenge, try them out.

## 3. Additional Content

Some modules may also have additional content at the end that isn't needed for USACO, but may be interesting. Feel free to read or skip them as you'd like.

## Code Conventions

The code we provide should follow the conventions below. Please note that you do _not_ have to copy our conventions; there is no "right" convention for coding!

### General

 - Binary operators should be spaced on both sides. For example, `a+b` should be written as `a + b` and `x=a+b` should be written as `x = a + b`.
 - Unary operators should only be spaced on the left side, ex. `x = -y`.
 - Braces that open on one line should close on another. Always include braces, even if the code inside them is only one line.
 - Parentheses should be spaced from the outside. For example, we would write `if (a == b) {` or `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {`.
 - Use `++x` rather than `x++` to increment a variable (ie. in a `for` loop).
 - Start your `else` statement on the same line as the closing brace of your `if` statement, like so:

	```cpp
	if (a == b) {
		++a;
	} else {
		++b;
	}
	```

 - Use `true / false` for boolean values, not `1 / 0`. 
 - Explain the use of any not well known standard library functions with comments that haven't been introduced before like `__builtin_ffs()` or `tie(a, b, c)` in C++.

### C++

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

using vi = vector<int>;
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define f first
#define s second
#define mp make_pair

void setIO(string name = "") { // name is nonempty for USACO file I/O
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL); // see Fast Input & Output
	freopen((name+".in").c_str(), "r", stdin); // see Input & Output
	freopen((name+".out").c_str(), "w", stdout);
}

int main() {
	setIO();

}
```

<!-- Avoid using tabs? Does this cause any problems on usaco-guide? -->

<!-- Any preferences? Also, this doesn't apply to the custom sorting module, make sure to include all 3! :) -->

 - Avoid the use of macros (`#define`) other than those in the template above. See "Shortening C++" for more information about macros.
 - Separate multiple operations on the same line with a comma like `a = b, c = d;` or split them into different lines and use semicolons.
 - Use `const` in C++ for variables that don't change through the code.
 - Use `make_pair` rather than `{}` to store a pair. 
 - Use `auto` to increase readability (ex. when dealing with iterators). 
 - Use `struct` instead of `class`. <!-- Even if you are copy pasting a `struct`, space it out rather than squeezing it into one line. -->
 - Use UpperCamelCase for custom structs (`SegTree, Point`) and lowerCamelCase for functions (`solve(), binarySearch()`). Constants should be fully capitalized (`INF, MOD, SOME_CONST`).

## Interactive Elements

Sometimes modules will contain interactive elements. Here are some of the more common ones.

<info-block title="Pro Tip">

</info-block>

<spoiler title="Hidden Content">

In some modules, codes or solutions will be placed in **spoiler blocks** like this. In these cases, you should think about the problem or try to implement it yourself before revealing the solution or code.

</spoiler>

<optional-content title="Optional Content">

Not all content in this guide is essential to competitive programming. Skipping over optional content is fine, but if you're interested, feel free to explore further as well.

<warning-block>

A warning block like this will contain common errors that you should avoid.

</warning-block>

<!-- Difficulty should be comparable across a division. Say that you have *almost-solved* a question if you scored at least $n-2$ out of $n$ test cases. At least for platinum, difficulty levels should correspond approximately to the following USA Pre-college almost-solve rates on a USACO contest:

	- Easy: $\ge 40\%$ (ex. Fort Moo, Team Building, Redistricting)
	- Normal: $\ge 20\%$ (ex. Card Game, Balancing, Gathering)
	- Hard: $\ge 10\%$ (ex. Mooriokart, Train Tracking 2, Friendcross)

Old gold problems should probably be bumped up one level. -->

<!-- Re: above. Almost-solved is subjective to problem though. Incorrect greedy "almost solves" deleg."" -->
