## Standard I/O

In most websites (such as CodeForces and CSES), input and output are **standard**.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

The [<iostream\>](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/) library suffices.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x; cin >> x;
    cout << "FOUND " << x << "\n";
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the [<cstdio\>](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/) library's `scanf` anf `printf` functions, which are slightly more complicated to use, but are significantly faster (generally only an issue with large input sizes):

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x, y;
    // %d specifies that a value of type int is being input.
    // Use %lld (a few judging platforms might need %I64d)
    // to input a long long (64-bit) integer.
    // Many other specifiers are also available; see link for more details.
    // Be sure to add a & character (address-of operator) when using
    // scanf, UNLESS you are inputing a string with %s.
    // It is possible to input multiple values at a time as shown below.
    scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);

    // Specifiers for printf are mostly the same as those used
    // by scanf, with the notable exception of floating-point numbers.
    // Use a backslash character followed by the lowercase
    // letter n to denote a newline.
    // The address-of operator, &, is not used here.
    printf("Found %d and %d\n", x, y);
}
```

In your CS classes, you've probably implemented input and output using standard input and standard output, or using [`Scanner`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html) to read input and `System.out.print` to print output. These methods work, but `Scanner` and `System.out.print` are slow when we have to handle inputting and outputting tens of thousands of lines. Thus, we use `BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter` instead, which are faster because they buffer the input and output and handle it all at once as opposed to parsing each line individually.

Here is a Java template for input and output, which is effectively a faster Scanner. We import the entire `util` and `io` libraries for ease of use.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class template {
    static class InputReader {
        BufferedReader reader;
        StringTokenizer tokenizer;

        public InputReader(InputStream stream) {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream), 32768);
            tokenizer = null;
        }

        String next() { // reads in the next string
            while (tokenizer == null || !tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
                try {
                    tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(reader.readLine());
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            }
            return tokenizer.nextToken();
        }

        public int nextInt() { // reads in the next int
            return Integer.parseInt(next());
        }

        public long nextLong() { // reads in the next long
            return Long.parseLong(next());
        }

        public double nextDouble() { // reads in the next double
            return Double.parseDouble(next());
        }
    }

    static InputReader r = new InputReader(System.in);
    static PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // YOUR CODE HERE

        pw.close(); // flushes the output once printing is done
    }
}
```

Here's a brief description of the methods in our `InputReader` class, with an instance `r`, and `PrintWriter` with an instance `pw`.


| Method             | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `r.next()`         | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns a `String`    |
| `r.nextInt()`      | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as an `int`   |
| `r.nextLong()`     | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as a `long`   |
| `r.nextDouble()`   | Reads the next token (up to a whitespace) and returns as a `double` |
| `pw.println()`     | Prints the argument to designated output stream and adds newline    |
| `pw.print()`       | Prints the argument to designated output stream                     |

## File I/O

In USACO, input is read from a file called `problemname.in`. After the program is run, output must be printed to a file called `problemname.out`. Note that you'll have to rename the `.in` and `.out` files depending on the problem. For example, for [this problem](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1035), you would replace `problemname` with `socdist1` to get `socdist1.in` and `socdist1.out`.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

You will need the [<cstdio\>](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/) or the [<fstream\>](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/) library. Essentially, replace every instance of the word `problemname` in the word below with the input/output file name, which should be given in the problem.

Below, we have included C++ templates for input and output. We use `using namespace std;` so that we don't have to preface standard library functions with `std::` each time we use them.

If `<cstdio>` is used:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    freopen("problemname.in", "r", stdin);
    freopen("problemname.out", "w", stdout);
    // rest of your code ...
}
```

If `<fstream>` is used: (Note that you cannot use C-style I/O (`scanf`, `printf`) with this method):

```cpp
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream fin("problemname.in");
    ofstream fout("problemname.out");
    // rest of your code ...
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

We can modify the template above to support file I/O.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class template {
    static class InputReader {
        BufferedReader reader;
        StringTokenizer tokenizer;

        public InputReader() throws FileNotFoundException {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("template.in"));
            tokenizer = null;
        }

        String next() { // reads in the next String
            while (tokenizer == null || !tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
                try {
                    tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(reader.readLine());
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            }
            return tokenizer.nextToken();
        }

        public int nextInt() { // reads in the next int
            return Integer.parseInt(next());
        }

        public long nextLong() { // reads in the next long
            return Long.parseLong(next());
        }

        public double nextDouble() { // reads in the next double
            return Double.parseDouble(next());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {

        InputReader r = new InputReader();
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("template.out")));

        // YOUR CODE HERE

        pw.close(); // flushes the output once printing is done
    }
}
```


Here's an example to show how input/output works. Let's say we want to write a program that takes three numbers as input and prints their sum.

```java
// InputReader template code above
static InputReader r = new InputReader(System.in);
static PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = r.nextInt();
    int b = r.nextInt();
    int c = r.nextInt()
    pw.println(a + b + c);
    pw.close();
}
```
