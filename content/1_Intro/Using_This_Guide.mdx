## How to Use This Guide

- Use the "Module Progress" dropdowns to track your progress through this guide!
- Use the "Contact Us" button on the bottom left corner of the screen (in the hamburger menu on phones) if something is unclear or if you need help.
- Read through all starred resources before continuing!
- We highly recommend doing all starred problems. If you need more practice, try some of the unstarred ones.

**Skipping around** is especially recommended for higher level contestants (Gold/Platinum). Feel free to <TextTooltip content="You can do this by scrolling to the end of a module">mark a module</TextTooltip> as "Skipped" and come back to it at a later time!

For lower level contestants, the guide is generally<Asterisk>There are some exceptions; for example, the last module in "Silver -> Sorting" assumes knowledge of the first two modules in "Silver -> Ordered Sets & Maps." In any case, we will list prerequisites to each module as needed.</Asterisk> designed to be completed in order. However, feel free to skip certain modules and come back to it later. In particular, **you may want to skip the General group** ("How to Practice," "Contest Strategy," "Additional Resources," and "Contests") and read it later.

## About This Guide

<warning-block title="This guide is NOT a syllabus!!">

Topics on this guide reflect _past_ problems, not _future_ problems. Contest problems may contain topics that aren't mentioned in this guide, and topics that appear in one division of this guide may appear in lower divisions in future contests.

</warning-block>

 - For Bronze, Silver, and Gold contestants, we aim to be a "**one stop shop**," meaning that this is the only site you have to use to be exposed to most (if not all) of the topics required for Bronze - Gold.<Asterisk>Of course, you should still use other websites as necessary.</Asterisk>
 - We'll link to online resources that already exist whenever possible instead of rewriting tutorials ourselves.
 - For Platinum contestants, we'll try our best to cover the main topics.<Asterisk>There are too many topics for us to effectively cover all of them. If you want to do well in Platinum, you will have to find additional resources on your own in addition to this site</Asterisk>
 - Difficulty ranges from "Very Easy" to "Insane." Difficulty is **not** comparable across modules (even of the same division).<Asterisk>Difficulty refers to how challenging a problem is after reading the module, not how difficult the problem is in general.</Asterisk>
    - "Intro" refers to a problem that just asks you to implement a standard algorithm or data structure.
