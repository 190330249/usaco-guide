**Two pointers** refers to iterating two monotonic pointers across an array to search for a pair of indices satisfying some condition in O(n).

## Tutorials

 - Intro to USACO 14.1
 - CPH 8.1

## Problems

 - [CSES Sum of Two Values](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1640)
 - [CSES Maximum Subarray Sum](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1643)

## Extensions

The two pointers technique can be extended to the two dimensional sliding window algorithm. If you're looking for a more challenging problem using 2-D sliding window, see [USACO Plat Fort Moo](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=600)
