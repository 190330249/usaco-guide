import { Problem } from "../models";

export const metadata = {
  problems: {
    general: [
      new Problem("Bronze", "Cow Tipping", "689", "Hard", false, [], "Cells in the last row and column can be toggled uniquely. Toggle the appropriate ones and then recurse to the rectangle in the previous row/column, and solve the same way."),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Race", "989", "Very Hard", false, [], "Greedily increment/decrement Bessies speed to fit the conditions until her total distance exceeds K."),

Some bronze problems don't fall into any specific category, such as compete search or rectangle geometry, and often require more thought while also being easier to implement. Any problem that doesn't fall under any well-defined category can be labelled as **Ad Hoc**. 

Since Ad Hoc problems don't fall under any specific category, they can be hard to generalize, so there is no fixed algorithm or idea to solving these problems. In this module, we'll go over some general tips that may be useful in approaching these problems and present some practice problems. 

## Tips for Approaching Ad Hoc Problems
<ul>
    <li> Draw lots of small cases to gain a better understanding of the problem. If you're having trouble debugging, draw more cases. If you don't know how to start with a problem, draw more cases. Whenever you don't know how to further approach a problem, you're probably missing an important observation, so draw more cases and make observations about properties of the problem. </li>
    <li> Whenever you find an observation that seems useful, write it down! Writing down ideas lets you easily come back to them later, and makes sure you don't forget about ideas that could potentially be the solution. </li>
    <li> Don't get stuck on any specific idea, unless you see an entire solution. Trying to complete search an Ad Hoc problem will just end up wasting a lot of your time in contest. </li>
    <li> Try to approach the problem from a lot of different perspectives. Try to draw a visual depiction of the problem, mess around with formulas, or model it as a Graph Theory problem (see Graph Theory module). One of the most helpful things you can do when solving Ad Hoc problems is to keep trying ideas until you make progress. This is something you get better at as you do more problems.</li>
</ul>

These tips are very useful in solving Ad Hoc problems. However, in the end, the best way to get better at Ad Hoc problems (or any type of problems) is to do a lot of them. Try to solve as many practice problems below as you can, and click the solution sketch tab if you can't figure the solution out.

## Greedy Problems

One thing to note about Ad Hoc problems in the USACO Bronze division is that many of them, while difficult to categorize into specific algorithms or data structures, can be solved using **Greedy** techniques. While this idea will be covered more in future [modules](https://usaco-guide.netlify.app/silver/greedy), we'll introduce the general mindset in this section.

When approaching a greedy problem, we want to make argument about the structure of the solution of the problem. Specifically, that certain "greedy" actions, or actions that create the best possible solution at some local point in the algorithm, will lead to an optimal solution at the end. 

Consider some possible greedy algorithms for the USACO Bronze problem "Mad Scientist."

<spoiler title="Correct Greedy Algorithm">

 In this problem, the correct greedy solution is to continually flip the longest possible ranges of mismatching cows. 

 Mad Scientist has an excellent [editorial](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_breedflip_bronze_feb20.html) with a video solution and intuitive proof. It is highly recommended you read it before continuing to gain a better understanding of the greedy algorithm.

However, not all greedy problems in the bronze division nessecarily require mathematical proofs of correctness. It is often good enough to intuitively convince yourself your algorithm is correct.

<info-block title="Pro Tip">
Sometimes, if the algorithm is easy enough to implement, you don't even need to convince yourself it's correct: just let the online judge prove it for you by coding it and seeing if it passes. This is often called a Proof by AC.
