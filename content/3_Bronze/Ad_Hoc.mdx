import { Problem } from "../models";

export const metadata = {
  problems: {
    general: [
      new Problem("Bronze", "Mad Scientist", "1012", "Normal", false, [], ""),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Cow Tipping", "689", "Hard", false, [], ""),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Race", "989", "Very Hard", false, [], ""),
    ],
  }
};

Some bronze problems (unfortunately) cannot be complete searched and may actually require some thought despite not requiring much implementation.

(ok idk whether there's actually something to be said about bronze ad hoc specifically)
