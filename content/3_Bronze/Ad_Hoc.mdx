import { Problem } from "../models";

export const metadata = {
  problems: {
    general: [
      new Problem("Bronze", "Mad Scientist", "1012", "Normal", false, [], "Flip all ranges that mismatch greedily."),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Cow Tipping", "689", "Hard", false, [], "Cells in the last row and column can be toggled uniquely. Toggle the appropriate ones and then recurse to the rectangle in the previous row/column, and solve the same way."),
      new Problem("Bronze", "Race", "989", "Very Hard", false, [], "Greedily increment/decrement Bessies speed to fit the conditions until her total distance exceeds K."),
    ],
  }
};

Some bronze problems (unfortunately) cannot be complete searched and may actually require some thought despite not requiring much implementation.

(ok idk whether there's actually something to be said about bronze ad hoc specifically)
