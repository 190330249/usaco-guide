title: "Rectangle Geometry"

The extent of "geometry" problems on USACO Bronze are usually quite simple and limited to intersections and unions of squares and rectangles. 

<!-- END DESCRIPTION -->

 - They usually only include two or three squares or rectangles, in which case you can simply draw out cases on paper. This should logically lead to a solution. 
  - Also, the coordinates typically only go up to $1000$, so a program that performs $\approx 1000^2$ operations (ex. with a nested for loop) should pass.
