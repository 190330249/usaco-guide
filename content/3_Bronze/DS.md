## Problems

**CSES:**

Do roughly the first half of the Sorting and Searching section in the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)

### Sets

#### Standard
- https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1621
- https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1091
  - Uses iterators
- https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1640
  - Uses iterators
  - Can be solved without sets

### Other Problems

  - [Polycarp's Phone Book](http://codeforces.com/contest/860/problem/B) [](56)
    - String processing, maps, brute force
    - Slightly hard for bronze, perhaps (very) easy silver?
  - [Jury Marks](http://codeforces.com/contest/831/problem/C) [](67)
    - Hard, would recommend skipping (1700 on CF)
  - [Mahmoud & Ehab & Function](http://codeforces.com/contest/862/problem/E) [](74)
    - Hard, do not attempt until Gold/Plat (2100 on CF)
