Storing multiple elements as a single unit allows you to change the order of the elements (e.g. sorting) without mixing one component with another.

**Example:** Given some points on a plane where the $i$-th point has coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$, sort these points in increasing order of $x$ coordinate and increasing order of $y$ in case there is a tie.

If you sort one of $x_i$ and $y_i$ without considering the other, the points will not be in the correct order. We need to consider the pair $(x_i,y_i)$ as a single unit.

## [Pairs](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/pair/)

 - `pair<type1, type2> p`: Creates a pair `p` with two elements with the first one being of `type1` and the second one being of `type2`.
 - `make_pair(a, b)`: Returns a pair with values `a`, `b`.
 - `{a, b}`: With C++11 and above, this can be used as to create a pair, which is easier to write than `make_pair(a, b)`.
 - `pair.first`: The first value of the pair.
 - `pair.second`: The second value of the pair.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  pair<string, int> myPair1 = make_pair("Testing", 123);
  cout << myPair1.first << " " << myPair1.second << endl; // Testing 123
  myPair1.first = "It is possible to edit pairs after declaring them";
  cout << myPair1.first << " " << myPair1.second << endl;
  
  pair<string, string> myPair2 = {"Testing", "curly braces"};
  cout << myPair2.first << " " << myPair2.second << endl; // Testing curly braces
}

/* Output
 * Testing 123
 * Testing curly braces
 * It is possible to edit pairs after declaring them 123
 */
```

## [Tuples](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/tuple/)

Of course, we can hold more than two values with something like `pair<int,pair<int,int>>`, but it gets messy when you need a lot of elements. In this case, using **tuples** might be more convenient.

 - `tuple<type1, type2, ..., typeN> t`: Creates a tuple with `N` elements, i'th one being of `typei`.
 - `make_tuple(a, b, c, ..., d)`: Returns a tuple with values written in the brackets.
 - `get<i>(t)`: Returns the $i$'th element of the tuple `t`. Only works for constant $i$. Can be used to change the element of a tuple.

Note that it is illegal to do something like the following since $z$ is not constant:

```cpp
tuple<int,int,int> t{3,4,5};
int z = 1; cout << get<z>(t);
```

 - `tie(a, b, c, ..., d) = t`: Equals `a, b, c, ..., d` to the elements of the tuple $t$ accordingly.

This is not frequently used by competitive programmers, but it is good to know and can help simplify things sometimes. 

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <tuple> /// needs additional library
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 3, b = 4, c = 5;
    tuple<int, int, int> t = tie(a, b, c);
    cout << get<0>(t) << " " << get<1>(t) << " " << get<2>(t) << endl;
    get<0>(t) = 7;
    cout << get<0>(t) << " " << get<1>(t) << " " << get<2>(t) << endl;

    tuple<string, string, int> tp2 = make_tuple("Hello", "world", 100);
    string s1, s2; int x;
    tie(s1, s2, x) = tp2;
    cout << s1 << " " << s2 << " " << x << endl;
}
/* Output
 * 3 4 5
 * 7 4 5
 * Hello world 100
 */
```

## Sorting Pairs & Tuples

  <resource source="CPH" title="3.2 - Comparison Operators" starred></resource>
</resources>

By default, C++ pairs are sorted by first element and then second element in case of a tie, which is precisely what we need for the example above.

Example from CPH:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  vector<pair<int,int>> v;
  v.push_back({1,5});
  v.push_back({2,3});
  v.push_back({1,2});
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());
  for (pair<int,int> p: v) cout << p.first << " " << p.second << "\n";
}

/* Output: 
1 2
1 5
2 3
*/
```

Tuples are sorted similarly.
