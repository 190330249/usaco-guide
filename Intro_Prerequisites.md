# Intro - Prerequisites

These resources do not teach you how to code. We recommend you learn roughly the first half of AP Computer Science A before continuing. We have linked some resources at the end of this document for this purpose.

## Choosing a Language

**Don't worry too much about the language!** If you already know a language, just use it. You can always switch languages down the road.

In general, we recommend the following:

- For Bronze and Silver contestants, any of C++/Java/Python will do.
  - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java, and Java over Python.
- For Gold and Platinum, we recommend C++/Java.
  - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java.

Keep in mind that it's easy to switch languages down the road! Don't get caught up on which language to choose. Just pick the one you feel most comfortable with!


## Resources for Learning to Code

[Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) has courses on C++, Java, and Python. You don't have to complete the full course.

- For C++, we recommend you finish Sololearn up to (but not including) "More on Classes."
