# Intro - Prerequisites

These resources do not teach you how to code. We recommend you learn roughly the first half of AP Computer Science A before continuing. If you do not meet these prerequisites, you can go to the resources below to get started.

## Resources for Learning to Code

[Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) has courses on C++, Java, and Python. You don't have to complete the full course.

- For C++, we recommend you finish Sololearn up to (but not including) "More on Classes."
