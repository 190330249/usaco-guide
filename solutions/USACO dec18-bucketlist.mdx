## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```python
file_in = open("blist.in")
data = file_in.read().strip().split("\n")
n = int(data[0])
cows = [list(map(int, data[i + 1].split(" "))) for i in range(n)]

# Initialize a variable to store the maximum number of buckets needed
max_buckets = cows[0][2]

# For each posssible time, check how many buckets are needed at that time
# Set the maximum equal to that value if it is larger than the current maximum
for i in range(1, 1001):
	buckets_at_this_time = 0
	for j in range(n):
		if i >= cows[j][0] and i <= cows[j][1]:
			buckets_at_this_time += cows[j][2]
	max_buckets = max(max_buckets, buckets_at_this_time)

file_out = open("blist.out", "w")
file_out.write(str(max_buckets))
file_out.close()
```
