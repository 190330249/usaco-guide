[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_sleepy_bronze_jan19.html)

In this problem, we are asked to find the minimum number of times steps before Farmer John will be able to completely sort the array of cows. We can think about this problem by looking at the end of the array of cows. Notice that if the last $i$ elements in the array are sorted in increasing order, since Famer John is acting optimally, he can fully sort the array in $n-i$ time steps. This is because, for the first $n-i$ numbers in the array, Farmer John can add them to space among the last $i$ elements such that they remain in increasing order, and notice that, by after $n-i$ time steps, the array of cows will be completely sorted. 

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```python
file_in = open('sleepy.in')
data = file_in.read().strip().split("\n")


n = int(data[0])
cows = list(map(int, data[1].split(" ")))

ans = 0

# Find the number of strictly increasing values at the end of the list
for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
    if cows[i] < cows[i-1]:
        ans = i
        break

file_out = open('sleepy.out', 'w')
file_out.write(str(ans))
file_out.close()
```
