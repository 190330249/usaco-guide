It is easiest to use the method of two pointers. The left pointer means the beginning of the segment of books to read, the right one - the end. 
When moving the left pointer one unit to the right, the right pointer should be repeatedly moved to the right as long as the sum of all
$a_i$ within the segment is less than or equal to $t$. This way, we can find for each possible left end the rightmost possible right end. 
The answer to the problem is the maximum length over all possible left ends.

```cpp
int main() {
	setIO(); 
	int N,T; re(N,T);
	vi A(N); re(A);
	int right = -1, ans = 0;
	F0R(left,N) {
		while (right+1 < N && T >= A[right+1]) T -= A[++right];
		ckmax(ans,right-left+1); // can read segment [left,right]
		if (right == left-1) right ++;
		else T += A[left];
	}
	ps(ans);
}
```
