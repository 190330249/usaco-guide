<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

As with many problems involving permutations, we can treat the elements of a permutation as nodes in a graph and draw edges between $i$ and $\pi_i$ for each $i$.

Notice how these edges form several disjoint cycles. What can you say about the order of a permutation based on the cycle it forms?

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

For some permutation, let $l_i$ be the length of the $i$-th cycle. The order of the permutation is simply $\text{lcm}(l_1, l_2, \dots)$, since cycle $i$ will periodically arrange its elements correctly after every $l_i$ compositions.

Additionally, notice that the maximal order of a permutation with $n$ elements is never less than the maximal order of a permutation with $n - 1$ elements.

To find the lexographically smallest permutation given its cycle lengths, a greedy approach works. Additionally, shorter cycles result in lexographically smaller permutations.

<Spoiler title="Hint 4">

All $l_i$ in an optimal permutation are pairwise coprime.

<Spoiler title="Proof">

Assume for a contradiction that in an optimal permutation, there are two cycles $i$ and $j$ with $l_i$, $l_j$ such that $g = \gcd(l_i, l_j) > 1$. We can replace those two cycles with three smaller cycles of length $l_i / g$, $l_j / g$, and $g$.

The resulting permutation is shorter, has the same order as the original, but is lexographically smaller, which contradicts our assumption.

All $l_i$ in an optimal permutation are prime powers.

<Spoiler title="Proof">

Assume for a contradiction that in an optimal permutation, there is a cycle $i$ with $l_i = p^a q^b x$ where $p$ and $q$ are different primes. We can replace that cycle with two smaller cycles of length $p^a$ and $q^b x$.

The resulting permutation is shorter, has the same order as the original, but is lexographically smaller, which contradicts our assumption.

<Spoiler title="Solution">

Let $dp[i][j]$ be the maximal order of a permutation with $i$ elements with all cycle lengths being powers of the first $j$ primes. The following recurrence holds:

$$
dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i][j - 1], \max_{1 \leq p_j^k \leq i}(dp[i - p_j^k][j - 1] \cdot p_j^k))
$$

The problem with this DP state is that the numbers can get far too large to store in a `long long`. Luckily, since we're working with products, we can store logarithms of the maximal orders instead. Our recurrence thus becomes:

$$
dp'[i][j] = \max(dp'[i][j - 1], \max_{1 \leq p_j^k \leq i}(dp'[i - p_j^k][j - 1] + \log(p_j^k)))
$$

We can use backtracking to restore the optimal permutation.

There are 1229 primes less than 10000, so we can implement this DP in a bit less than $\mathcal{O}(1229 n)$ time and memory. However, this approach uses too much memory.

Intuitively, we need to limit the number of prime powers that we try - after all, it's highly unlikely that a permutation of length $\approx$ 10000 will have a large cycle of length $\approx$ 9000.

As it turns out, we only need to use the first 70 prime numbers!

<Spoiler title="Proof">

The following proof is translated from the official Polish editorial:

**Definition 1:** Let $K_n$ be the smallest $k$ such that for each $k' \geq k$, we have $dp[n][k'] = dp[n][k]$.

**Definition 2:** Let $\overline{K_n}$ be the smallest $k$ such that for each $k' \geq k$ **and** each $n' \leq n$, we have $dp[n'][k'] = dp[n'][k]$.

We can express $\overline{K_n}$ in terms of $K_n$ as such:

$$
\overline{K_n} = \max_{0 \leq n' \leq n}(K_{n'})
$$

Clearly, if $k \ge \overline{K_n}$, then using only the first $k$ primes is sufficient.

**Lemma:** Let $n \geq 1$. If $h$ satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
- $p_{h + 1} > n$.
- $h \geq \overline{K_{n-1}}$ and $dp[n][h] \geq n \cdot dp[n - p_{h + 1}][h]$.

then we know that $K_n \leq h$.

**Proof:** Clearly, if $p_{h + 1} > n$, we can't use it or any subsequent primes, so $dp[n][h + 1] = dp[n][h]$. Let's assume instead that only the second condition holds.

We will now prove inductively that for $k' > h$, we have $dp[n][k'] = dp[n][h]$. Assume that $dp[n][k' - 1] = dp[n][h]$. If $p_{k'} > n$, then we are done. Assume that $p_{k'} \leq n$. Consider some $\alpha$ such that $p_{k'}^\alpha \leq n$. Since $h \geq \overline{K_{n - 1}}$, we have:

$$
p_{k'}^\alpha \cdot dp[n - p_{k'}^\alpha][k' - 1] = p_{k'}^\alpha \cdot dp[n - p_{k'}^\alpha][h]
$$

$k' > h$, so we know that $n - p_{k'}^\alpha \leq n - p_{h + 1}$. Additionally, since $dp[n][k] \leq dp[n'][k]$ when $n \leq n'$, we have:

$$
p_{k'}^\alpha \cdot dp[n - p_{k'}^\alpha][h] \leq p_{k'}^\alpha \cdot dp[n - p_{h + 1}][h]
$$

We thus get:

$$
p_{k'}^\alpha \cdot dp[n - p_{h + 1}][h] \leq n \cdot dp[n - p_{h + 1}][h] \leq dp[n][h]
$$

From the inductive hypothesis, we have $dp[n][h] = dp[n][k' - 1]$, so we get:

$$
p_{k'}^\alpha \cdot dp[n - p_{k'}^\alpha][k' - 1] \leq dp[n][k' - 1]
$$

and we can thus conclude that $dp[n][k'] = dp[n][k' - 1] = dp[n][h]$. Therefore, by induction, $K_n \leq h$.

Using this lemma, we can write an auxilliary algorithm to find that $\overline{K_n} = 70$.

This improves our memory usage significantly, so our solution now uses only $\mathcal{O}(70 n)$ time and memory.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 1e4, MAX_P = 70;

                    };

double mem[MAX_N + 1][MAX_P];
bool visited[MAX_N + 1][MAX_P];
int backtrack[MAX_N + 1][MAX_P];

double dp(int n, int pos = 0) {
    if (pos == primes.size() || primes[pos] > n) return 0;
    if (visited[n][pos]) return mem[n][pos];

    double ans = dp(n, pos + 1);
    backtrack[n][pos] = 0;
    for (int p_pow = primes[pos], expo = 1; p_pow <= n; p_pow *= primes[pos], expo++) {
        double potential = expo * log(primes[pos]) + dp(n - p_pow, pos + 1);
        if (ans < potential) {
            ans = potential;
            backtrack[n][pos] = p_pow;
        }
    }
    visited[n][pos] = true;
    return mem[n][pos] = ans;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n--) {
        int m;
        scanf("%d", &m);
        dp(m);
        vector<int> lens;
        for (int pos = 0; pos < primes.size(); m -= backtrack[m][pos++]) {
            if (backtrack[m][pos]) lens.push_back(backtrack[m][pos]);
        }
        while (m--) lens.push_back(1);
        sort(lens.begin(), lens.end());
        for (int i = 0, j = 1; i < lens.size(); j += lens[i++]) {
            for (int k = 1; k < lens[i]; k++) printf("%d ", j + k);
            printf("%d ", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Alternatively, you can notice that $dp[i]$ depends only on $dp[i - 1]$ and that bitsets use 8 times less memory than boolean arrays. This means that you can cut down on the memory usage without limiting the number of prime numbers you check. 

Here's Ben's code, which implements this idea:

```cpp
array<ld,10001> ans, tmp;
bitset<10001> z[1300];
bool pri[10001];
vi co, CO;

void fin(int x) {
    pi cur = {x,sz(co)-1};
    vi zz;
    int lastUse = 0;
    while (cur.s != -1) {
        if (z[cur.s][cur.f] && lastUse != CO[cur.s]) {
            lastUse = CO[cur.s];
            cur.f -= co[cur.s]; zz.pb(co[cur.s]);
        }
        cur.s --;
    }
    sort(all(zz));
    int sum = 0; trav(t,zz) sum += t;
    vi ret;
    sum = x-sum;
    F0R(i,sum) ret.pb(i+1);
    trav(t,zz) {
        FOR(j,sum,sum+t-1) ret.pb(j+2);
        ret.pb(sum+1);
        sum += t;
    }
    trav(z,ret) pr(z,' ');
    ps();
}

int main() {
    setIO(); 
    int d; re(d); vi v(d); re(v);
    int mx = 0; trav(t,v) ckmax(mx,t);
    FOR(i,2,mx+1) pri[i] = 1;
    F0R(i,mx+1) ans[i] = 1;
    FOR(i,2,mx+1) if (pri[i]) {
        tmp = ans;
        for (int j = 2*i; j <= mx; j += i) pri[j] = 0;
        for (int j = 1; pow(i,j) <= mx; j ++) {
            int x = pow(i,j);
            FOR(k,x,mx+1) {
                if (x*ans[k-x] > tmp[k]) {
                    tmp[k] = x*ans[k-x];
                    z[sz(co)][k] = 1;
                    // ps("WUT",sz(co),k);
                }
            }
            co.pb(x); CO.pb(i);
        }
        swap(ans,tmp);
    }
    trav(x,v) fin(x);
}
```
