[GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inverting-burrows-wheeler-transform/) does an okay (?) job of explaining it and giving some intuition. But the code can be so much shorter ...

## My Implementation

Let $t[0\ldots n-1]$ be the BWT of $s[0\ldots n-1]$, where $s$ ends with a character that is smaller than all other characters in $s$ (`#` in this case). 

Consider all indices modulo $n$. If $t_i$ corresponds to $s_{x_i-1}$ (the last character of the $i$-th smallest rotation) then define

$$
a_i=s_{x_i}s_{x_i+1}\ldots s_{x_i-1}
$$
$$
b_i=s_{x_i-1}s_{x_i}s_{x_i+1}\ldots s_{x_i-2}
$$

$a_i$ corresponds to the $i$_th smallest rotation of $s$, and $b_i$ is formed by cyclically shifting $a_i$ by one character. $t_i$ is the last character of $a_i$ and the first character of $b_i$. 

Define $j=\texttt{nex}[i]$ to be the unique $j$ such that $b_j=a_i$. Then we know that $x_{j}=x_i+1$. Given $\texttt{nex}$, we can compute

$$
x_0=n-1
$$
$$
x_{\texttt{nex}^1[0]}=0
$$
$$
x_{\texttt{nex}^2[0]}=1
$$
$$
\vdots
$$

so $s_i=s_{\texttt{nex}^{i+1}[0]}=t_{\texttt{nex}^{i+2}[0]}$ for all $i$.

We know that 
$$
b_i<b_j\Longleftrightarrow (t_i,a_i)<(t_j,a_j) \Longleftrightarrow (t_i,i)<(t_j,j),
$$ 
so we can sort the $b_i$ using a stable sort. Then $\texttt{nex}[i]$ is just the index of the $i$-th rotation in this sort!

```cpp
str reverseBW(str t) {
	vi nex(sz(t)); iota(all(nex),0);
	stable_sort(all(nex),[&t](int a,int b){return t[a]<t[b];});
	str s; for (int i = nex[0]; i; ) 
		s += t[i = nex[i]];
	return s;
}
// reverseBW("cb#ab") = "babc"
```
