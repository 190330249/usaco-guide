[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_helpcross_silver_feb17.html)

There is more than one possible greedy strategy (though all of them involve sorting the animals by time). Here, we follow the approach described by the analysis.

```cpp
int C,N;
priority_queue<int,vi,greater<int>> times; // stores B_i of cows
// top element of priority queue is lowest

int main() {
	setIO("helpcross"); 
	re(C,N);
	vi chicks(C); vpi cows(N); re(chicks,cows);
	sort(all(chicks)); sort(all(cows));
	int cow_ind = 0, ans = 0;
	trav(c,chicks) { // go through chickens in increasing order of time
		while (cow_ind < sz(cows) && cows[cow_ind].f <= c) // add cows with A_i <= c
			times.push(cows[cow_ind++].s);
		while (sz(times) && times.top() < c) times.pop(); 
		// popped cows can't be paired with chicken
		if (sz(times)) ans ++, times.pop(); 
		// matched chicken to cow with lowest possible B_i
	}
	ps(ans);
}
```
