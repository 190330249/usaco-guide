## Solution (Vector Cross Product)

Vector cross product can be used to determine if 2 vectors are rotating clockwise or anticlockwise.
For this question, if we treat each step that Farmer John walks as a vector and do cross production of the current step against
previous step and sum all the cross product values. We can determine the overall direction is CW or CCW based on the sign of sum.

## Implementation

```python
def cross_product(p1, p2):
    return p1[0] * p2[1] - p2[0] * p1[1]

for i in range (int(input())):
    p0 = (0, 0)
    sum = 0
    direction = input()
    for d in direction:
        if d == 'N':
            p1 = (p0[0], p0[1] + 1)
        elif d == 'E':
            p1 = (p0[0] + 1, p0[1])
        elif d == 'S':
            p1 = (p0[0], p0[1] - 1)
        else:
            p1 = (p0[0] - 1, p0[1])
        sum += cross_product(p1, p0)
        p0 = p1

    if sum > 0:
        print("CW")
    else:
        print("CCW")
```
