[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_prob1_bronze_jan21.html)

In this problem, we are asked to find the minimum number of times that Bessie must
hum the entire cowphabet to have sung every letter in the given string in order.
For every character in the string, we want to know if the next character in the
string appears before this character in the cowphabet. If this is true, we know
that we have to increment the number of times that Bessie must hum the cowphabet
as Bessie cannot hum the cowphabet backwards, and thus must hum it again in order
to reach the next character.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(length(string))$

```python
# Take in the cowphabet and string as strings through standard Python input
cowphabet = input("")
word = input("")

# For any string, we always have to look through the cowphabet at least once.
num_times = 1

for i in range(len(word) - 1):
    # Check if next character in string appears before previous character
    if cowphabet.index(word[i + 1]) <= cowphabet.index(word[i]):
        num_times += 1

print(num_times)
```
