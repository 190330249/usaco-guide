## Solution 1
[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_hps_bronze_jan17.html)

## Solution 2 - Generating All Permutations

Idea: We can map the games to every possible permuation and find which one gives us the most wins. This works because $1 \leq N \leq 100$

### Implementation
<LanguageSection>
<PySection> 

```py
from itertools import permutations
import sys

sys.stdin = open('hps.in', 'r')
sys.stdout = open('hps.out', 'w')

n = int(input())
games = []

for _ in range(n):
	games.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

# Original Ordering 
# 1 = Hoof, 2 = Paper, 3 = Scissors
choices = [1, 2, 3]

# in these cases, cow 1 wins
# hoof beats scissors, 
# scissors beats paper, 
# and paper beats hoof
scenarios = [[1, 3], [3, 2], [2, 1]]

# generates all permutations
pers = list(permutations(choices, 3))

maxwins = 0

for j in pers:
	wins = 0
	for i in games:
		selection = [j[i[0]-1], j[i[1]-1]]
		if selection in scenarios:
			wins+=1
	maxwins = max(maxwins, wins)

print(maxwins)
```
