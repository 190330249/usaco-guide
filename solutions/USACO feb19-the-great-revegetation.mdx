/*
Make 2 adjacency lists, one for edges with the same "color" (S) , and another for edges with different colors (D).
Read in each "edge", and put it into the same adj list or the different adj list depending on whether the type is 'S' or 'D'.

The answer will be 2^(number of connected components), unless it is impossible to properly color the graph, in which case the answer is 0.
This is because you can flip the colors of the nodes of each connected component.
For example -  if you have color 1 and color 2, you can change all the nodes with color 1 to color 2, and vice versa.

Keep track of the number of connected components.
Loop through each node. If the node has not been visited before, increment the number of seen components.
Then start DFS-ing from that node.

---------------------
DFS(node, color).
First we have to mark the node with  that color.
Loop through all nodes that are supposed to have the same color.
    -If it is unvisited, mark it with that color.
    - Or else if it is already colored with the other color, then the graph is broken and it is impossible to color the graph properly.

Loop through all nodes that are supposed to have a different color.
    -If it is unvisited, mark it with the other  color.
    - Or else if it is already colored with this color, then the graph is broken and it is impossible to color the graph properly.
