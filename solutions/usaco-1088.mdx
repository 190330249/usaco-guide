```py
n = int(input())
# grid_by_rows[i] is the ith row
grid_by_rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
# grid_by_cols[i] is the ith column
grid_by_cols = zip(*grid_by_rows)

rows_alternate, cols_alternate = 0, 0

for i in range(n):
	# each row has an alternating pattern of cow and no cow
	row = grid_by_rows[i]  # the ith row
	# row[::2] is a list of every other element, starting with index 0
	# row[1::2] is a list of every other element, starting with index 1
	rows_alternate += max(sum(row[::2]), sum(row[1::2]))

	# each column has an alternating pattern of cow and no cow
	col = next(grid_by_cols)  # the ith column
	# col[::2] is a list of every other element, starting with index 0
	# col[1::2] is a list of every other element, starting with index 1
	cols_alternate += max(sum(col[::2]), sum(col[1::2]))

print(max(rows_alternate, cols_alternate))
```
