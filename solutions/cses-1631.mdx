## Explanation

Let $\texttt{sum}$ be $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n t_i$.

Sort the array in ascending order. Kotivalo can read the books in the order $t_n, t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n-1}$, and Justiina can read them in the order $t_1, t_2, t_3, ..., t_n$. 

If $\texttt{sum} - t_n < t_n$, Justiina would finish reading books $t_1, t_2, t_3, ..., t_{n-1}$ and would have to wait for Kotivalo to finish reading $t_n$. Afterwards, Justiina can read $t_n$ and Kotivalo can read $t_1, t_2, t_3, ..., t_{n-1}$. In total, this will take $2 \times t_n$ units of time.

If $\texttt{sum} - t_n \ge t_n$, Kotivalo would finish reading $t_n$ before Justiina finishes reading $t_1, t_2, t_3, ..., t_{n-1}$, so Justiina would not have to wait for Kotivalo to finish reading $t_n$. Thus, this will take $\texttt{sum}$ units of time.

Therefore, the answer is $\max(\texttt{sum}, 2 \times t_n)$.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

int main() {
	ll n;
	cin >> n;

	vector<ll> t(n);
	for (ll i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> t[i];
	}

	ll mx = *max_element(t.begin(), t.end());
	ll s = accumulate(t.begin(), t.end(), 0ll);

	cout << max(s, mx * 2) << "\n";
}
```
