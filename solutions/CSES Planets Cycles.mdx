Define the number of teleportations starting from a planet as the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of that planet. For each planet that hasn't been visited, we want to find its $\texttt{pathlength}$. Call the planet we are performing $\texttt{dfs}$ from the $\textit{start}$. As we perform $\texttt{dfs}$ from the $\textit{start}$, keep track of the planets seen, in order, in the $\texttt{path}$ queue and keep track of the $\texttt{steps}$, the length of the path so far. When we reach a planet that has already been visited (call this planet the $\textit{repeat}$), add the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of the $\textit{repeat}$ to the current $\texttt{step}$ count because we would continue to visit all of the planets that $\textit{repeat}$ would go on to visit. 

Once we have $\texttt{path}$ and $\texttt{steps}$ (the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of the $\textit{start}$) we can calculate the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of all the planets in this $\texttt{path}$. We know the $\textit{repeat}$ will always be the planet at the end of the $\texttt{path}$, but it may appear elsewhere as well. We can break this down into two cases:
1. The $\textit{repeat}$ was visited twice in the current $\texttt{path}$. Let the planets in the $\texttt{path}$ between the two occurrences of the $\textit{repeat}$ be the $\textit{cycle}$.
2. The $\textit{repeat}$ was visited previously and only appears at the end of the current $\texttt{path}$. All of the planets in the $\texttt{path}$ are not part of a $\textit{cycle}$.

For planets inside a $\textit{cycle}$, the repeating planet when starting from that planet is itself. For all the planets outside the $\textit{cycle}$, the planet that repeats when starting from each planet will still be the $\textit{repeat}$.

Since the planets outside the $\textit{cycle}$ all have paths ending at the $\textit{repeat}$, each one's $\texttt{pathlength}$ is $1$ less than the previous'. So, as we iterate through the planets outside the $\textit{cycle}$, the $\texttt{pathlength}$ will decrease by $1$ each time, starting from $\texttt{steps}$. Once we get to the $\textit{cycle}$, the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of the planets will all be equal to the $\texttt{pathlength}$ of the $\textit{repeat}$, which is the length of the $\textit{cycle}$.
