## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

```python
# Take in input using Python file i/o system
file_in = open('whereami.in')
data = file_in.read().strip().split("\n")
n = int(data[0])
mailboxes = data[1]

# Set the answer initially to n, as we know n is always a possible answer
ans = n

# We can iterate through lengths of sequences to find the smallest length
for l in range(1, n + 1):
    # Store all sequences of length n in a set
    # Sets only hold distint elements
    sequences = set()
    for i in range(n - l + 1):
        sequences.add(mailboxes[i : i + l])
    # Check if this value equals the possible number of sequences of length l
    # If this is true, all sequences of length l are unique, so this l works
    if len(sequences) == (n - l + 1):
        # When a specific length works, we can store that as our answer
        ans = l
        # We can exit the loop as this will be the smallest working length
        break

# Add final answer to output file using Python file i/o system
file_out = open('whereami.out', 'w')
file_out.write(str(ans))
file_out.close()
```
