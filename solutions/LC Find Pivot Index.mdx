title: Find Pivot Index

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O(N)$.

## Solution

The pivot index must have the same sum on its left and its right. To calculate this, we can create a prefix sum of the $\texttt{nums}$ array (in my solution it is cushioned with one $0$ at index $0$). Afterwards, all we need to do is to loop through every index from $0$ (inclusive) to $\texttt{nums}.length$ (exclusive) in the $\texttt{psums}$ array and check for:

$$
\texttt{psums}[i] - \texttt{psums}[0] == \texttt{psums}[\texttt{nums}.length] - \texttt{psums}[i+1]
$$

If this returns true, we can return our answer because the problem wants the left-most index. If it finishes the for-loop without returning, it means there is no pivot index so return $-1$.

class Solution {
    public int pivotIndex(int[] nums) {
        int[] psums = new int[nums.length+1];
        
        for(int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++){
            psums[i+1] = psums[i] + nums[i];
        }
        

        
        for(int i = 0; i<psums.length-1; i++){
            if(psums[i] - psums[0] == psums[nums.length] - psums[i+1]){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
