## $\mathcal{O}(N)$ Solution With Graphs

While the solutions provided in the editorial work for the given bounds,
there *is* a solution that works in just $\mathcal{O}(N)$, involving graphs!

Notice that since the input is guaranteed to be valid, we're always going to end
up with "chains" of cows that we can arrange as we please. Using the sample given
in the problem, we'd get a "chain" representation like this:

![](usaco-965/chains.png)

Note that cows that are not part of any chain can be considered their own chains
of length 1 for implementation purposes.

With this representation in mind, we can iterate through the cows in
lexicographical order. When we visit a cow that could be a possible
start of a chain (AKA a cow that only has one required neighbor),
we go through its neighbors (adding cows as we go along) until we hit an end.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
