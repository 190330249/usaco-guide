**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$

Binary search on the minimum time it will take for all the Packmen to eat all the pellets.
For each Packman, we can greedily calculate the maximum number of pellets that it can eat in the given amount of time and then remove those pellets.
Note that a Packman will visit all pellets between the leftmost and rightmost pellets a it eats, so it can eat all of them without any time penalty. Also, they must be non-intersecting because if they were, either Packman can ignore the pellets of the other Packman.

In the below solution, we keep a sorted deque of all the pellet positions. For each Packman, we calculate the maximum amount of pellets it can eat so that no more pellets are to the left, and then we remove all those pellets from the deque.
However, if a Packman can't eat the leftmost uneaten pellet, then this time would be invalid.
There are two main cases we consider for each Packman: one where the Packman first goes to the right and then to the left, and another where the Packman first goes to the *left* and then to the right. We calculate the pellet eaten in both of these cases and take the maximum.
