[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_prob1_silver_feb22.html)

## Explanation

Similar to the official analysis, I constructed directed edges from $i$ to $j$ if cow $i$ prefers gift $j$ to gift $i$.
If cow $i$ is able to receive a gift where it has an outgoing edge, then the solution will always be more optimal. 
Remember to also add an edge between cow $i$ and $i$ in the case where it cannot get a more preferred gift.

Then, I separated the graph into strongly connected components. If $i$ is in a strongly connected component, this means that cow $i$ can receive
all gifts in the strongly connected component through a series of reassignments and is guaranteed to have one or more preferred gift (including itself) based 
on SCC definition. Obviously you only want to assign cow $i$ with a more preferred gift.
## Implementation

Kosaraju's algorithm can be used to find all strongly connected components in the graph. At the end, it is optimal to just go down cow $i$'s preference list and assigned the first gift belonging in the SCC.
**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 501;

// for kosaraju purposes
vector<int> graph[N], revgraph[N]; // revgraph is the reversed graph
vector<bool> vis(N), vis2(N);
vector<int> path;

// stores all nodes in a SCC
set<int> comp;

void dfs(int node){
    vis[node] = true;
    for(int i: graph[node]){
        if(!vis[i]){
            dfs(i);
        }
    }
    path.push_back(node);
}

void dfs2(int node){
    vis2[node] = true;
    for(int i: revgraph[node]){
        if(!vis2[i]){
            dfs2(i);
        }
    }
    comp.insert(node);
}
signed main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n; cin>>n;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        // NOTE that graph array serves as its preference list and an adjacency list of the directed graph.
        graph[i].resize(n);
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            cin>>graph[i][j];
        }
        // we don't want edges to non-preferred gifts so remove all gifts after its original assignment
        while(graph[i].back() != i){
            graph[i].pop_back();
        }
        for(int j: graph[i]){
            revgraph[j].push_back(i);
        }
    }

    // classic kosaraju implementation
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        if(!vis[i]){
            dfs(i);
        }
    }
    reverse(path.begin(),path.end());

    vector<int> ans(n+1);
    for(int i: path){
        if(!vis2[i]){
            dfs2(i);
            // loop over all cows in the SCC and its preference list.
            // If we find a gift in its preference and also in the SCC, just assign it.
            for(int j: comp){
                for(int k: graph[j]){
                    if(comp.count(k)){
                        ans[j] = k;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            comp.clear();
        }
    }
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        cout<<ans[i]<<endl;
    }
}
