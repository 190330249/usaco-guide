We can view the temperatures as an array $v$. We want to decrement one contiguous interval by a value $d \le x$ such that the length of the longest increasing subsequence is longest possible.

# Subtasks 1-3: Brute Force
One key observation is that it is useless to subtract $d$ from any interval $[l,r]$ as opposed to just $[1, r]$ for any other $l \neq 1$. Additionally, observe that it is optimal to simply subtract $x$ from the interval $[1, r]$ instead of some other $d < x$.

An $O(n^2 \lg n)$ algorithm would involve brute forcing for all prefixes. Subtract $x$ from each interval $[1, i]$ for all $i \in \{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ and then find the LIS after each subtraction.

# Subtask 4: One pass
Simply take the LIS of the array. Any $O(n \lg n)$ algorithm to find the LIS will pass.

# General Solution
For each $i$, let $L_i$ be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at $i$ and $R_i$ be the length of the longest decreasing subsequence with smallest value $v_i - x$, which would be the equivalent of the longest increasing subsequence starting at $i$ after $[1, i)$ is decremented. The final answer is $\max_{i \in \{0, 1, \dotsc, n\}} L_i+R_i-1$.

# Implementation
In the implementation $L_i$ is $dp_i$ and $R_i$ is the variable $j$ introduced on line $28$. (More precisely, $j$ is $R_i-1$.)

	vector<ll> lis(n);
	fill(lis.begin(), lis.end(), INT_MAX);
	ll k = 0;
	// longest increasing subsequence ending at i
	for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		int j = lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), v[i])-lis.begin();
		lis[j] = v[i];
		dp[i] = j+1;
		k = max(k, dp[i]);
	}
	fill(lis.begin(), lis.end(), INT_MAX);
	// longest decreasing subsequence ending at i = longest increasing subsequence starting at i
	for(int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--)
	{
		int j = lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), -v[i]+x)-lis.begin();
		int jj = lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), -v[i])-lis.begin();
		lis[jj] = -v[i];
		k = max(k, dp[i]+j); // minus one because i would be included twice
	}
	cout << k << endl;
