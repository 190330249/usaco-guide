[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/r/data/sol_moobuzz_silver_dec19.html)

For every 15 numbers, there are only 8 numbers spoken. (see image below)

![](solutions/USACO-dec19-moobuzz-silver/first30_relation.png)

Therefore, we can just get the distance away $N$ is from the first $8$ by calculating $\lfloor N / 8 \rfloor \times 15$, since we have to add $15$ for every grouping of $15$. 

Now it's just a matter of adding the corresponding first $8$ to the answer. 

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $ \mathcal{O}(1)$

```py
import sys

sys.stdin = open('moobuzz.in', 'r')
sys.stdout = open('moobuzz.out', 'w')

N = int(input())

# Lists the first 8. 
# 14 is in the zeroth position since if were trying to find the 
# eigth number, 8 % 8 = 0.
first8 = [14, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13]

# Finds the group.
ans = (N - 1) // 8 

# Distance away N is from the first 8.
ans *= 15

# Adds the corresponding element.
ans += first8[N % 8]

print(ans)
