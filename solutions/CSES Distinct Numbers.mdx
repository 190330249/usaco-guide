This problem asks us to calculate the number of distinct values in a given list.

There are two ways to approach this problem: We can either use a `set`, or we can sort the array.

# Using a Set

This is probably the easier of the two methods, but requires knowledge of sets. If you're still on [Bronze - Intro to Data Structures](/bronze/intro-ds), skip down to the "Sorting the Array" solution.

Because sets only store one copy of each value, we can insert all the numbers into a set, and then print out the side of the set.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    set<int> distinctNumbers;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int number; cin >> number;
        distinctNumbers.insert(number);
    }

    cout << distinctNumbers.size() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

# Sorting the Array

This problem is also solvable without sets. Sort a vector containing all the numbers. The answer is the number of times two adjacent numbers are not equal; more formally, the number of times $a_i \neq a_{i + 1}$, $+ 1$.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int A[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> A[i];
    }

    sort(A, A+n);

    int answer = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (A[i] != A[i + 1]) {
            answer++;
        }
    }

    cout << answer << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
