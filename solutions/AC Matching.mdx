## Solution

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\cdot 2^N)$

If we define $\texttt{dp}[S]$ to be the number of matchings for females in the
set $S$ to the first $|S|$ males, this problem boils down to the following:

$$
\texttt{dp}[S] = \sum \texttt{dp}[S\backslash x]:  \texttt{compatible}[|S|][x]
$$

In English, this is equivalent to the following:

> The number of matchings in a subset $S$ to include a certain female $x$ is
> equivalent to the sum of all the matchings without female $x$ where female $x$
> is compatible with the $|S|$-th male.

Our base case is the empty set, which has a value of $1$ (the empty set can be
considered as a single matching involving zero pairs).

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool compat[21][21];
int dp[1 << 21];

int N;

int main() {
	cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin >> N;
	for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) for(int j = 0; j < N; j++) cin >> compat[i][j];

	dp[0] = 1;

	for(int s = 0; s < (1 << N); s++) {
		int v = __builtin_popcount(s);
		for(int x = 0; x < N; x++) {
			if((s & (1 << x)) || !compat[v][x]) continue;
			dp[s | (1 << x)] += dp[s];
			dp[s | (1 << x)] %= (int)1e9+7;
		}
	}

   	cout << dp[(1 << N) - 1];
}
```
