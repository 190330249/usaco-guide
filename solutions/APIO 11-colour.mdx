## TL;DR

If we view the grid as a graph, we get $K$ connected components. The answer is then either $2^{K - 1}$ or $0$ and
we use 2-SAT to determine which one it is.

## Intuition

Let $c(x, y) = 1$ if the cell $(x, y)$ is blue and $0$ otherwise. For convenience, also add a row 0 and column 0.

Firstly, notice that if we already know the colour of 3 cells in a $2 \times 2$ table, then we also know the last colour.

From this, we get the recurrence $c(x, y) = \lnot (c(x - 1, y - 1) \oplus c(x - 1, y) \oplus c(x, y - 1))$
for all $x, y > 1$.

After analysing this recurrence, we find that we actually have $c(x, y) = \lnot (c(0, 0) \oplus c(0, y) \oplus c(x, 0) \oplus ((x \cdot y) % 2))$

I made a [helpful spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cSNyb3wBq39R2FsSD-kuPpfBsLXCVxSXKsqllo2sUs0/edit?usp=sharing)
for you to visualise this.

## Counting the Colourings

Without loss of generality, let the cell $(0, 0)$ be red (since its colour doesn't change the answer). This means
that without any already-coloured cells, all cells $(x, 0)$ and $(0, y)$ are independent.

However, an already-coloured cell $(x, y)$ makes the 2 cells $(x, 0)$ and $(0, y)$ depend on each other.

View the grid as a graph:
- All cells $(x, 0)$ and $(0, y)$ are nodes.
- For each already-coloured cell $(x, y)$, add an edge between $(x, 0)$ and $(0, y)$.

This creates $K$ connected components. The answer is thus either $2^{K - 1}$ or $0$.
This is because each node in a connected component is dependent on the other nodes in that component
and all connected components are independent.
If it simply isn't possible to colour the table, the answer is $0$.

Since the colours of the already-coloured cells give us some boolean equations, we can thus use 2-SAT
to check whether they are all satisfiable.

## Complexity

Time: $O(N)$.

Memory: $O(N)$.

## Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define FOR(i, x, y) for (int i = x; i < y; i++)
typedef long long ll;
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9;

int x[100001], y[100001], cmp[400001];

int find(int A) {
    while (A != cmp[A]) cmp[A] = cmp[cmp[A]], A = cmp[A];
    return A;
}
void onion(int A, int B) { cmp[find(A)] = cmp[find(B)]; }

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    int n, m, k;
    cin >> n >> m >> k;
    FOR(i, 0, 2 * (n + m)) cmp[i] = i;

    FOR(i, 0, k) {
        int c;
        cin >> x[i] >> y[i] >> c;
        c ^= (x[i] & 1) && (y[i] & 1);

        if (c) {
            onion(x[i], y[i] + n);
            onion(x[i] + m + n, y[i] + 2 * n + m);
        } else {
            onion(x[i] + m + n, y[i] + n);
            onion(x[i], y[i] + 2 * n + m);
        }
    }

    int cnt = -1;
    FOR(i, 0, n + m) {
        if (find(i) == find(i + n + m)) return cout << "0", 0;
        if (find(i) == i) cnt++;
    }

    int ans = 1;
    FOR(i, 0, cnt) ans = (ans * 2) % MOD;
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```
