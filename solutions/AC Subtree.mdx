## Solving for one root

Let's consider a simpler problem - assuming that node 1 is painted black, how many ways can we paint the tree?

First, root the tree at node 1.

Let $dp[i]$ be the number of ways that we can paint the subtree of node $i$ if we know that node $i$ is painted black. (1 if node $i$ is a leaf)

For each child $c$ of $i$, there are $dp[c] + 1$ ways to paint its subtree if $i$ is painted black.

This means that we have the recurrence

$$
dp[i] = \prod_{c \in \text{Children of } i} (dp[c] + 1)
$$

The answer to the simpler problem is thus $dp[1]$.

Finding all $dp[i]$ takes $O(N)$ time.

## Solving for all roots

First, root the tree arbitrarily and do a DFS to find all $dp[i]$.

Let $dp2[i]$ be the number of ways to colour the tree if we remove node $i$'s subtree excluding node $i$ from the graph and we know that node $i$ is painted black. (1 if node $i$ is the root)

The number of ways to paint the tree if we know node $i$ is black is simply $dp[i] \cdot dp2[i]$.

How can we find $dp2[i]$ efficiently though?

The basic recurrence for computing $dp2[i]$ is

$$
dp2[i] = (dp2[\text{Parent of } i] + 1) \cdot \prod_{s \in \text{Siblings of } i} (dp[s] + 1)
$$

Since $M$ isn't guaranteed to be prime though, we can't just find the product of each node's children and divide that product by each of its children's $dp[i]$. (Since we can't find modular inverses easily.)

However, notice how if node $i$ is the $k$-th child of its parent, then we can use prefix and suffix products to compute

$$
\prod_{s \in \text{Siblings of } i} (dp[s] + 1)
$$

without using division. (i.e. We find the product of $dp[s] + 1$ for the first to the $(k - 1)$-th child of $i$'s parent, the product of $dp[s] + 1$ for the $(k + 1)$-th to the last child of $i$'s parent, and then multiply those together.)

Finding all $dp2[i]$ takes $O(N)$ time using a DFS, so the total complexity of this algorithm is thus $O(N)$.

## Code

```cpp
template<int SZ> struct SubtreeDP {
	int par[SZ]; vi adj[SZ];
	void ae(int a, int b) { adj[a].pb(b), adj[b].pb(a); }
	struct T {
		mi v = 1;
		T& operator+=(const T& b) { v *= b.v; return *this; }
		void tran() { ++v; }
	};
	T up[SZ], down[SZ];
	void dfs(int x) {
		trav(t,adj[x]) if (t != par[x]) {
			par[t] = x; dfs(t);
			down[x] += down[t];
		}
		down[x].tran();
	}
	void dfs2(int x) {
		{
			T pre = up[x];
			F0R(i,sz(adj[x])) {
				int c = adj[x][i]; if (c == par[x]) continue;
				up[c] += pre; pre += down[c];
			}
		}
		{
			T pre;
			R0F(i,sz(adj[x])) {
				int c = adj[x][i]; if (c == par[x]) continue;
				up[c] += pre; pre += down[c];
			}
		}
		F0R(i,sz(adj[x])) {
			int c = adj[x][i]; if (c == par[x]) continue;
			up[c].tran(); dfs2(c);
		}
	}
	T getSub(int x, int y) { return par[x] == y ? down[x] : up[y]; }
	void init(int n) {
		par[1] = 0; dfs(1); dfs2(1);
		FOR(i,1,n+1) {
			T p = T(); trav(t,adj[i]) p += getSub(t,i);
			ps(p.v);
		}
	}
};

int main() {
	setIO(); int n; re(n,MOD);
	SubtreeDP<MX> S;
	F0R(i,n-1) {
		int a,b; re(a,b);
		S.ae(a,b);
	}
	S.init(n);
}
```
