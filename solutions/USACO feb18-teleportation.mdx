## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$

```python
# Take in data using Python file i/o system
file_in = open('teleport.in')
data = file_in.read().strip().split('\n')
[a, b, x, y] = list(map(int, data[0].split(' ')))

# Manually sort a, b to be increasing order
if a > b:
    a, b = b, a

# Manually sort x, y to be increasing order
if x > y:
    x, y = y, x

# Set base distance as distance needed to travel without using teleporter
base_distance = abs(a - b)

# Set teleporter distance to be the minimal travel distance using teleporter
# He must go from a to x as otherwise, the teleporter would move him backwards
# He must then move from point y to point b
teleporter_distance = abs(a - x) + abs(b - y)

# The answer is the smaller of the two distances
ans = min(teleporter_distance, base_distance)

# Output the answer using Python file i/o system
print(ans, file=open('teleport.out', 'w'))
```
