title: LeetCode Largest Rectangle in Histogram
author: Andi Qu, Benjamin Qi

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal O(N)$.

## Solution 1

The largest rectangle must have the same height as the shortest bar that it contains. For each $i$, consider the largest rectangle with height $H[i]$ such that bar $i$ is the shortest bar it contains. The answer is simply the largest of these $N$ rectangles.

Since the heights of these rectangles are fixed, we just want them to be as wide as possible. Notice how the rectangle of bar $i$ is bounded by the the closest shorter bars on each side of bar $i$ (or the ends of the histogram if these bars don't exist).

We can use a monotone stack twice to find the closest shorter bars on each side of each bar. See [the stacks module](https://usaco.guide/gold/stacks#application-nearest-smaller-element) for more details.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
		int n = heights.size();
		if (!n) return 0;
		stack<int> stck;
		vector<int> area(n, 0);
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			while (stck.size() && heights[stck.top()] >= heights[i]) stck.pop();
			int width = i - (stck.size() ? stck.top() : -1);
			area[i] += width * heights[i];
			stck.push(i);
		}
		while (stck.size()) stck.pop();
		for (int i = n - 1; ~i; i--) {
			while (stck.size() && heights[stck.top()] >= heights[i]) stck.pop();
			int width = (stck.size() ? stck.top() : n) - i;
			area[i] += (width - 1) * heights[i];
			stck.push(i);
		}
		return *max_element(area.begin(), area.end());
	}
};
```

## Solution 2

Actually, we only need to go through the heights in one direction. When we see `(i, heights[i])`, we process all rectangles with right end at `i-1` and height greater than `heights[i]`. Note how we add `-1` to the list of `heights` so we don't have to treat rectangles that end at the last height in `heights` as a special case.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
		heights.pb(-1);
		vi st{-1};
		int ans = 0;
		F0R(i,sz(heights)) {
			while (st.bk != -1 && heights[st.bk] >= heights[i]) {
				// consider rectangle spanning columns end(st)[-2]+1 to i-1
				// min height is heights[st.bk]
				ckmax(ans,(i-1-end(st)[-2])*heights[st.bk]);
				st.pop_back();
			}
			st.pb(i);
		}
		return ans;
	}
};
```
