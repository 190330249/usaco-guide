title: CSES Stick Divisions
author: Dong Liu

In this problem, we're asked to find the minimum cost to divide a stick with length $x$ into $n$ sticks with given lengths.
This is also known as a [Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding#Basic_technique) problem.

The algorithm used to find the minimum cost of the Huffman tree is to first take two nodes of the least weight, merge them, then insert the merged node into the list of nodes.

In C++, this can be done easily with the [Priority Queue](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/priority_queue/). You might also find [this discussion](https://forum.usaco.guide/t/proof-of-cses-stick-divisions/40) on the USACO Forum useful.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);
    int x, n; cin >> x >> n;
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > PQ;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
      int a; cin >> a;
      PQ.push(a);
    }
    long long ans=0;
    for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
      int a=PQ.top(); PQ.pop();
      int b=PQ.top(); PQ.pop();
      PQ.push(a+b);
      ans += a+b;
    }
    
    cout << ans <<"\n";    
    return 0;
}
```
