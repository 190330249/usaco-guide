/solutions/Instead of counting the number of bad pairs, count the number of good pairs and subtract that from the total number of all pairs. Notice how if we remove a node, we get several connected components. We can then use biconnected components to determine the sizes of these components and so we can count the number of good pairs after removing each node.	/problem/solution/poi-08-blockade

/solutions/I view it as a N x 3 lattice-pattern of edges. The top two layers correspond to an 'entrance' and 'exit' node for each array element, connected by an edge of flow 1 and cost -1. These are the only nodes with costs. Each 'exit' node points to to next 'exit' node of the same value, and also point to the 3rd layer. The 3rd layer tracks modulos, and points to the next layer 3 node with the same modulo. Every entrance node has at most 3 in-edges: from the closest +1 exit node, the closest -1 exit node, and the closest layer 3 node with the same modulo. Overall a graph with $approx 3N$ nodes and $approx 9N$ edges.	/problem/solution/cf-818G

/solutions/Treat areas that currently have K-1 layers of paint as having a value of 1, those having K layers of paint as having a value of -1, and the rest as having a value of 0. For each pair of x-coordinates, find the maximum subrectangle whose left side is located at the first x-coordinate and the right side is located at the second x-coordinate. This can be done with maximum subarray sum and prefix sums of each row. Do something similar with each pair of y-coordinates (fixing the top and bottom of the rectangle). Also notice that whenever two disjoint rectangles are drawn, there always exists a horizontal or vertical line separating them. Enumerate the location of the line, and find maximum subrectangle of each side using the information that we precalculated.	/problem/solution/usaco-923
