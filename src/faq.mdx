## Q: What is USACO?

USACO stands for USA Computing Olympiads. It is one of the several organizations in USA that selects teams of students to participate in their respective olympiads. In this case, the IOI (International Olympiads in Informatics). 

## Q: How do I take a USACO contest?

USACO has around 4 contests every year from December to April. These contests have a flexible four-day window for you to take the contest in. All you have to do to participate is to create an account with your credentials and join the contest with the link provided during the contest period.

## Q: What are the rules for USACO?

USACO's contest rules can be found [here](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=instructions). Please keep those rules in mind during contest!

## Q: What language should I use for USACO?

In general, we recommend the following:

- **If you already know one of these languages, just use it.**
  - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java, and Java over Python.
- **For Bronze, any language will do.** It is possible to receive full credit with C++, Java, and Python in Bronze.
- **For Silver, if Python is the only language you know / you really want to use Python, you can still pass Silver with Python. However for Gold and Platinum, Python is not recommended**, because it is a slow language and lacks an ordered map.

Don't overthink choosing a language -- you can always change languages later!

We cover choosing a language in more detail in our ["Choosing a Language"](https://usaco.guide/general/choosing-lang) module.

## Q: What type of questions are tested for USACO?

USACO mainly tests algorithmic problems. This requires creative thinking and knowledge of different algorithms to solve. Each division has its individual topics which you can find in [USACO guide](https://usaco.guide/) or you can scroll down and find the topics here in the FAQ page.

## Q: How do I prepare for USACO?

Learn algorithms, do practice problems, and reflect on why you're missing problems. Make sure you learn from every problem you do, and you'll improve over time. If you're looking for a guided roadmap to improve at USACO, check out the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) (that's this site!). USACO guide organizes each division's topics into a nice online guide to get you started. It contains all you need for USACO. However, if you feel unconfident with self-studying, there are many USACO classes that you can take! Check out a past USACO finalist's perspective on [USACO classes VS. using USACO guide](https://forum.usaco.guide/t/usaco-classes-vs-self-studying-with-usaco-guide/335).

If you want to get better at USACO, the key thing is to **do more practice**!

## Q: What's the best resource to get better at USACO?

We made the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) specifically to provide high-quality resources to help people get better at USACO; we encourage you to give it a shot! We also list [additional USACO resources](https://usaco.guide/general/resources-cp) that you may find helpful.

## Q: I'm stuck. Where can I get help for USACO?

Asking in the [USACO Forum](https://forum.usaco.guide/) is probably a good place to start. It has many active USACO finalists and already asked questions. In addition, the forum has many other people who can help with your problem!

## Q: How does USACO contest scoring work?

USACO Contests are scored out of 1000 points. Each contest typically has 3 problems (sometimes 4); each problem is weighted equally, and is typically worth $1000 / 3 = 333$ points. Each problem then has a number of test cases (typically 10), and each test case is weighted equally. For example, if a contest has three problems, and problem A has 10 test cases, then you will get $333/10 = 33$ points for each test case that you get correct for problem A.

At the end of the contest, a "cutoff score" for each division is determined based on the difficulty of the contest. If your score is above the "cutoff score" for your division, then you get promoted to the next division. The cutoff score varies significantly and is typically around $750$ points.

If you get a perfect score during the contest (ie. you solve all three problems correctly), then you get an "in-contest promotion," where you immediately get promoted to the next division. You can start the next division's contest whenever you want during the contest window; your four-hour timer resets when you start the contest.

## Q: When should I read the solution for USACO?

It really comes down to personal preference; there's no right or wrong answer -- do what works for you! With that being said, we've asked numerous top USACO competitors what they think about this question. This module lists their thoughts on [how to effectively practice for USACO](https://usaco.guide/general/practicing).

## Q: Should I implement every problem that I solve?

Usually, yes (unless the problem is significantly too easy for you). Solving competitive programming problems consists of two parts: coming up with the algorithm, and implementing the algorithm. You should implement so that you practice both parts.

## How do I submit a solution to USACO?

During contest, there is a dropdown menu and a file upload button at the bottom of the page. Choose your language and upload your program file accordingly. The same procedures apply for past contest submissions. For C++, attach your .cpp file not the .exe file. For Java, attach your .java file. For Python, attach your .py file.

## Q: What topics do I need to know for each of the USACO divisions?

While there is no official USACO syllabus, we've compiled topics for each division from historical contests:

- [USACO Bronze Topics](https://usaco.guide/bronze)
- [USACO Silver Topics](https://usaco.guide/silver)
- [USACO Gold Topics](https://usaco.guide/gold)
- [USACO Platinum Topics](https://usaco.guide/plat)

## Q: What CodeForces rating corresponds to each of the USACO divisions?

There isn't a perfect relationship between CodeForces rating and USACO divisions, since CF emphasizes solving problems quickly (6-8 problems under 2 hours time constraint), while USACO has harder problems and more time (3 problems in 4-5 hours).

- USACO Bronze users are probably <1400 rated on CF, and Bronze problems correspond to 900-1500 rated CF problems.
- USACO Silver users are probably 1300-1600 rated on CF, and Silver problems correspond to 1200-1900 rated CF problems.
- USACO Gold users are probably 1600-1900 rated on CF, and Gold problems correspond to 1500-2200 rated CF problems.
- USACO Platinum users are probably 1750+ rated on CF, and Platinum problems correspond to 1900+ rated CF problems.
