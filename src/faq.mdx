## Q: What language should I use for USACO?

In general, we recommend the following:

- **If you already know one of these languages, just use it.**
  - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java, and Java over Python.
- **For Bronze, any language will do.** It is possible to receive full credit with C++, Java, and Python in Bronze.
- **For Silver<Asterisk>However, if Python is the only language you know / you really want to use Python, you can still pass Silver with Python.</Asterisk>, Gold, and Platinum, Python is not recommended**, because it is a slow language and lacks an ordered map.

Don't overthink choosing a language -- you can always change languages later!

We cover choosing a language in more detail in our ["Choosing a Language"](https://usaco.guide/general/choosing-lang) module.

## Q: How do I prepare for USACO?

Learn algorithms, do practice problems, and reflect on why you're missing problems. Make sure you learn from every problem you do, and you'll improve over time. If you're looking for a guided roadmap to improve at USACO, check out the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) (that's this site!).

If you want to get better at USACO, the key thing is to **do more practice**!

## Q: What's the best resource to get better at USACO?

We made the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/) specifically to provide high-quality resources to help people get better at USACO; we encourage you to give it a shot! We also list [additional USACO resources](https://usaco.guide/general/resources-cp) that you may find helpful.

## Q: I'm stuck. Where can I get help for USACO?

Asking in the [(unofficial) USACO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/bessMBe) is probably a good place to start. They have channels called #cp-discussion and #cp-help specifically dedicated to questions about competitive programming. You can also ask for help by submitting feedback in unclear modules.

## Q: How does USACO contest scoring work?

USACO Contests are scored out of 1000 points.

## Q: When should I read the solution for USACO?

It really comes down to personal preference; there's no right or wrong answer -- do what works for you! With that being said, we've asked numerous top USACO competitors what they think about this question. This module lists their thoughts on [how to effectively practice for USACO](https://usaco.guide/general/practicing).

## Q: Should I implement every problem that I solve?

Usually, yes (unless the problem is significantly too easy for you). Solving competitive programming problems consists of two parts: coming up with the algorithm, and implementing the algorithm. You should implement so that you practice both parts.

## Q: What topics do I need to know for each of the USACO divisions?

// todo

## Q: What CodeForces rating corresponds to each of the USACO divisions?

There isn't a perfect relationship between CodeForces rating and USACO divisions, since CF emphasizes solving problems quickly (6-8 problems under 2 hours time constraint), while USACO has harder problems and more time (3 problems in 4-5 hours).

- USACO Bronze users are probably <1400 rated on CF, and Bronze problems correspond to 900-1500 rated CF problems.
- USACO Silver users are probably 1300-1600 rated on CF, and Silver problems correspond to 1200-1900 rated CF problems.
- USACO Gold users are probably 1600-1900 rated on CF, and Gold problems correspond to 1500-2200 rated CF problems.
- USACO Platinum users are probably 1750+ rated on CF, and Platinum problems correspond to 1900+ rated CF problems.
