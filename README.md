A free collection of curated, high-quality resources to take you from Bronze to Platinum and beyond.

All markdown files belong in `content/`. Other files are for the front-end website interface.
As much as possible, please try to keep the markdown files independent of the front-end implementation.

## Documentation

## Tech Stack

Our front-end is built with:

- React
- Gatsby
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS & Tailwind UI
- Netlify

Content is written in Markdown ([MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)), with limited Latex support from [Katex](https://katex.org/) and some custom components.
