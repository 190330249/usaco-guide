## Choosing a Language

If you're in Bronze, **Don't worry about the language!** If you already know a language, just use it. You can always switch languages down the road.

In general, we recommend the following:

- For Bronze contestants, any of C++/Java/Python will do.
  - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java, and Java over Python.
- For Silver, Gold, and Platinum, we recommend C++/Java.
  - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java.

Note: A majority of high level contestants use C++ and Java. Between those, C++ is more popular.

Keep in mind that it's easy to switch languages down the road! Don't get caught up on which language to choose. Just pick the one you feel most comfortable with!
